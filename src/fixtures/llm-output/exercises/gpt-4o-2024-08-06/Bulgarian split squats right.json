  "name": "Bulgarian Split Squat (Right)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing about two feet in front of a bench or sturdy elevated surface with your feet shoulder-width apart. Ensure the bench is stable and won't slip or move.\n\n2. Lift your right leg and place the top of your right foot on the bench behind you. Your left leg should be positioned forward about two feet from the bench.\n\n3. Adjust your position here to ensure you feel stable and balanced. The front foot should be firmly planted on the ground, and your weight should be evenly distributed.\n\n4. Keep your core engaged, your chest up, and your shoulders back. Hands can be held on your hips or by your sides, or hold dumbbells if you're adding weight.\n\n5. Initiate the movement by bending your left knee and lowering your body towards the ground. Your right knee will naturally lower as well. Lower down until your left thigh is parallel to the ground, or as far as your mobility allows.\n\n6. Ensure that your left knee remains in line with your left toes and does not extend past them to protect the joint.\n\n7. Drive through your left heel and extend your left knee as you rise back up to the starting position.\n\n8. Focus on maintaining your balance and moving deliberately and smoothly throughout the exercise.\n\n9. Complete the desired number of repetitions, then switch legs and repeat for your left side.",
