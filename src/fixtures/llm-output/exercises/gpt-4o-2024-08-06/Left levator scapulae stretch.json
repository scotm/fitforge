  "name": "Left Levator Scapulae Stretch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by sitting or standing up straight in a comfortable position. Ensure that your posture is relaxed, with shoulders down and back.\n\n2. Slowly tilt your chin downward toward your chest, as if you are trying to look at your left armpit. This movement will bring your head to the direction of your left shoulder.\n\n3. Place your left hand on top of your head or the back of your head if it is more comfortable, applying gentle pressure to help guide your head further into the stretch.\n\n4. You should feel a gentle stretch along the right side of your neck, particularly near the shoulder blade. Maintain the stretch, ensuring it's comfortable and not painful.\n\n5. Hold this position for 15 to 30 seconds, taking deep breaths to help relax the muscles further.\n\n6. Slowly release the stretch by bringing your head back to the neutral position, keeping movements slow and controlled to avoid sudden tension.\n\n7. Repeat the stretch on the right side if desired, or perform 2-3 repetitions if you are focusing on the left-side stretch for additional flexibility or relief.",
