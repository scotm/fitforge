  "name": "Sloper hanging",
  "how_to_perform": "*1. Find a pull-up bar that is sufficiently high and has a wide enough surface to support your body weight.\n*2. Place your hands on the bar with your fingers facing away from you, about shoulder width apart. Note: For sloper hang (you'll only use your fingers), place your hands close together, near each end of the bar.\n*3. Lift your feet off the ground and support your entire body weight by just your fingers.\n*4. Engage your core muscles to maintain control over your lower abs.\n*5. Maintain a tight grip on the pull-up bar with both sets of hands (or your fingers). You should feel tension in your forearms, shoulders, back, chest, and core. Try not to swing yourself up or rely on momentum - keep your movements controlled at all times.\n*6. Hold the sloper hang for a maximum time as instructed.",
