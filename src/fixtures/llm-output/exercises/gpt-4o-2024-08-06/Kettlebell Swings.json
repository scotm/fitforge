  "name": "Kettlebell Swings",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, with the kettlebell on the floor in front of you. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at your hips to reach down and grab the kettlebell handle with both hands, palms facing down. Keep your back straight and chest open.\n\n2. **Prepare for the Swing**: Engage your core muscles and draw your shoulders back. The movement should be initiated with a hip hinge, not a squat.\n\n3. **Execute the Swing**: Push your hips back as if you're attempting to touch an invisible wall behind you. Swing the kettlebell back between your legs while maintaining a slight bend in your knees.\n\n4. **Drive Up**: Forcefully drive your hips forward to propel the kettlebell up to shoulder height. Keep your arms straight but relaxed through the upward swing. The power for the swing should come from your hips and glutes, not your arms or shoulders.\n\n5. **Control the Descend**: Allow the momentum of the kettlebell to naturally bring it back down, keeping your arms straight. As it descends, hinge at the hips and bring the kettlebell back between your legs.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Continue swinging, maintaining a natural rhythm and control. Ensure each swing is powered by the hip thrust, not by using the arms. Repeat for your desired number of repetitions.",
