  "name": "Kettlebell Swings",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with a slight bend in your knees. Place the kettlebell on the ground slightly in front of you.\n\n2. **Grasp the Kettlebell:** Hinge at your hips (not a squat), reach forward with both hands, and grasp the handle of the kettlebell firmly.\n\n3. **Set your Back:** Pull your shoulders back and down to engage your lats, keep your chest up, and maintain a neutral spine.\n\n4. **Hike the Kettlebell:** With a slight bend in your knees, hike the kettlebell back between your legs, similar to hiking a football. Keep the motion controlled and avoid rounding your back.\n\n5. **Drive the Hips Forward:** Powerfully thrust your hips forward to propel the kettlebell upward to approximately shoulder height. The arms are an extension of the momentum created by your hips. Keep your core tight throughout.\n\n6. **Control the Descent:** Allow the kettlebell to return back down by hinging at the hips and controlling the swing back between your legs. Do not squat down.\n\n7. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, keeping each swing controlled and maintaining proper form throughout.",
