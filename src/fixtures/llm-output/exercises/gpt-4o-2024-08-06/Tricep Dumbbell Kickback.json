{
  "name": "Tricep Dumbbell Kickback",
  "how_to_perform": "* **Core Engagement:** Start by engaging your core muscles to maintain a stable posture.\n* **Grip and Positioning:** Hold a dumbbell with each hand, palms facing towards your body. Bend your knees slightly and stand on the floor or sit on a bench if needed for balance support.\n* **Movement Initiation:** As you kick back, lift your dominant leg behind you while keeping the other foot in front but not weight-bearing, to maintain proper posture. This helps prevent any potential strain on your lower back when performing leg lifts. Your arms should be straight with the dumbbells at the starting position.\n* **Tricep Activation:** Focus on contracting your triceps by bringing the dumbbell towards your glutes while keeping your upper arm still and only moving your forearm. This movement is similar to completing a push-up exercise, moving the weight without bending the elbow but focusing more on extending the lower portion of the arm.\n* **Dumbbell Kickback:** As you continue lifting with your triceps, maintain a posture that supports proper engagement throughout your movement. Once fully extended in this lifted position, pause briefly to emphasize complete activation before lowering it slowly back to the initial position. Ensure smooth transitions and avoid swinging motions as these can affect proper form and cause irritation.\n* **Repeat:** Perform for the recommended number of repetitions, ensuring to maintain control while engaging your triceps. Rest adequately between sets.",
