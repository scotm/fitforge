  "name": "Bent Over Row to External Rotation",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Begin with initial setup**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).\n\n2. **Assume the bent-over position**: Hinge at your hips and lower your torso closer to parallel with the ground. Keep your back straight and core engaged.\n\n3. **Row phase**: Initiate the movement by pulling the dumbbells upwards toward your ribcage. Your elbows should drive back while keeping them close to your body. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\n\n4. **Pause momentarily**: Once the dumbbells reach your body, hold the position briefly to feel the contraction in your back muscles.\n\n5. **External rotation phase**: Keeping the elbows bent, rotate your shoulders externally by turning your forearms until your knuckles face upward â€“ this will rotate the dumbbells slightly while maintaining a strong, stable shoulder position.\n\n6. **Return to start**: Reverse the external rotation, bringing the forearms back down, then slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position by extending your arms.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Perform the exercise for the recommended number of repetitions, maintaining control and avoiding any swinging motion.",
