  "name": "Kneeling Kickbacks",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Begin by getting onto all fours on an exercise mat, placing your hands directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Ensure that your back is flat and your head is aligned with your spine.\n\n2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine throughout the exercise. Avoid arching or rounding your back.\n\n3. **Perform the Kickback**: Keeping your knee bent, lift your right leg by driving your heel towards the ceiling while maintaining a 90-degree bend in your knee. Your foot should be flexed towards the shin. Lift until your thigh is parallel to the floor or slightly higher, but do not overarch your back.\n\n4. **Hold**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your glutes and hold for a brief second.\n\n5. **Return**: Slowly lower your leg back to the starting position.\n\n6. **Repeat and Switch**: Complete the desired number of repetitions on the right leg before switching to your left leg. \n\n7. **Breathing**: Exhale as you lift your leg and inhale as you lower it back down.\n\n8. **Maintain Form**: Keep your core engaged throughout the movement to protect your lower back and ensure you're working the glutes effectively.\n\nPerform 10-15 reps per leg for 2-3 sets, or as per your fitness routine.",
