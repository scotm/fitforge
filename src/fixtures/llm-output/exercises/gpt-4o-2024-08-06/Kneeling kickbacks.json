  "name": "Kneeling Kickbacks",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin on a mat, positioning yourself on all fours with your hands shoulder-width apart and directly under your shoulders. Your knees should be hip-width apart, forming a 90-degree angle, and directly under your hips.\n\n2. Keep your spine and neck in a neutral position by looking down at the mat and engaging your core muscles. This will help maintain stability and prevent arching your back.\n\n3. Choose a starting leg. Keeping your knee bent at a 90-degree angle, lift your starting leg slowly up towards the ceiling. Your foot should be flexed, as if you're trying to push the sole of your foot towards the ceiling.\n\n4. Lift the leg until your thigh is in line with your torso or as far as your flexibility allows without straining or arching your back.\n\n5. Hold at the top for a brief moment, squeezing your glutes to engage the muscles fully.\n\n6. Slowly lower your leg back to the starting position without touching the knee to the ground, maintaining tension throughout the movement.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions (10-15 is typical), then switch to the other leg and perform the same number of repetitions.\n\n8. Focus on form and control rather than speed, ensuring both hips remain stable and level throughout the exercise.\n\n9. Breathe naturally throughout the exercise, exhaling as you lift the leg and inhaling as you lower it.",
