  "name": "Leg Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set up the machine:** Adjust the seat of the leg press machine to ensure that your knees are at a 90-degree angle when your feet are on the platform. Make sure your back is supported by the backrest.\n\n2. **Position your feet:** Sit down and place your feet shoulder-width apart on the platform. Your toes should point slightly outward, and your heels should be flat against the platform.\n\n3. **Set your posture:** Ensure your back is flat against the backrest and your chest is up. Grip the side handles if the machine is equipped with them to help maintain stability.\n\n4. **Release the safety locks:** Depending on the machine, you may need to push the platform slightly to release the safety catches. Make sure to follow the specific instructions for your leg press model.\n\n5. **Start the exercise:** Press against the platform with your heels and extend your legs. Do not lock your knees out completely; keep a slight bend to maintain tension on the muscles and keep your joints safe.\n\n6. **Descend:* Slowly lower the platform by bending your knees, bringing them towards your chest. Keep your feet flat and engaged with the platform throughout the movement. Lower until your legs are at a 90-degree angle or as far as your flexibility allows without lifting your back off the rest.\n\n7. **Repeat:** Press the platform away again, using the same controlled motion, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\n8. **Return the safety locks:** Once you have completed your set, make sure the machine's safety locks are re-engaged before you release the weight.",
