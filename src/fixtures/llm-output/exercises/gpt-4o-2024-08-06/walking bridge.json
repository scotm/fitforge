  "name": "Walking Bridge",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Getting into Position**:\n   Sit on the floor with your legs straight out to one side, lying on your back in a prone position.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: \n   Keep your feet flexed and together, toes pointing downwards.\n\n3. **First Bridge**:\n   Engage your core and slowly lift your hips off the ground by pressing your heels into the floor. Focus on lifting from your upper glutes and lower back muscles.\n\n4. **Walking Motion**:\n   As you lift, bring one knee towards your chest while keeping the other foot flat. The foot that is still in contact with the floor should push against the ground for support.\n\n5. **Lowered Position**: \n   Lower your lifted leg to the starting position and repeat on the opposite side. Each half-lift is a bridge motion when performed in a slow and controlled manner, targeting your gluteal muscles primarily.\n\n6. **Continuation of Exercise**:\n   Continue alternating each leg to simulate the action of walking by slowly switching between right foot first onto left foot (and vice versa). Focus on maintaining a steady pace, lifting your hips with control by fully engaging your core every step of the process.\n\n7. **Targeted Area**: \n   Throughout this exercise, focus specifically on contracting the gluteus maximus muscles to enhance hip elevation and stability in each half-step taken.\n8. **Repeat for Duration**:\n   Train as desired, following a rhythm that allows you to walk with your bridges lasting throughout each step, targeting both quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, core, and stabilizing functions of the pelvis effectively.",
  "short_summary": "The Walking Bridge is an exercise designed to engage multiple lower body muscles through slow contractions of each leg simulating a walking motion. It involves alternating between lifting one knee towards your chest with controlled bridge movements while maintaining foot support from ground interactions using core muscle engagement for stabilization throughout the full exercise process.",
