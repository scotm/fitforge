  "name": "Leg Press (Wide Stance)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Machine:** Start by adjusting the seat and backrest of the leg press machine so that you can sit comfortably with your back flat against the pad. Ensure your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle when your feet are on the platform.\n\n2. **Position Your Feet:** Place your feet on the platform wider than shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be slightly pointed outwards. This wider stance targets the inner thigh muscles more effectively.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core:** Sit back into the seat and engage your core muscles. Grip the handles beside the seat for stability and support.\n\n4. **Unlock the Safety Mechanism:** Most leg press machines have a safety bar or lock. Carefully unlock the safety to allow the sled or platform to move freely.\n\n5. **Perform the Press:** Slowly press the platform upward by straightening your legs, ensuring your knees donâ€™t lock fully. Keep them slightly bent at the top of the movement.\n\n6. **Lower the Weight:** In a controlled manner, bend your knees to lower the platform back toward your body. Stop when your knees are at a 90-degree angle or just before your hips lift off the seat.\n\n7. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions. Maintain control and avoid jerking the weight to prevent injury.\n\n8. **Re-Engage the Safety:** After completing your set, carefully engage the safety mechanism before attempting to exit the machine.\n\n9. **Exiting the Machine:** Once the safety is engaged, gently push yourself up and step off the machine.",
