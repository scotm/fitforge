The grip should be shoulder-width apart. \\n3. Keep your elbows close to your torso and your back straight throughout the movement. \\n4. While keeping your upper arms stationary, curl the weights upwards by bending your elbows. Raise the weights until your forearms come almost into contact with your upper arms. \\n5. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause, squeezing your forearms. \\n6. Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position with control. \\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. \\n\\nMaintain a controlled motion throughout to avoid swinging the weights, which can place undue stress on your lower back.",
