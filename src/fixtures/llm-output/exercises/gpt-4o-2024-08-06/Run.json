  "name": "Run",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Warm-Up**: Begin with a 5-10 minute brisk walk or a light jog to prepare your muscles and joints. Perform dynamic stretches focusing on your legs and core.\\n2. **Start with a Proper Stance**: Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Keep your chest open, shoulders down and back, and head held high looking forward.\\n3. **Begin Running**: Lean slightly forward and start running by striking the ground first with the middle of your foot, rolling through to the toes.\\n4. **Maintain Form**: Keep your elbows bent at about 90 degrees allowing your arms to swing naturally with each stride. Your hands should move from chin to pocket. Avoid clenching the fists; keep them relaxed.\\n5. **Breathing**: Inhale and exhale deeply through the mouth and nose, maintaining a regular breathing pattern. Aim for a rhythm that matches your stride, such as inhaling for two steps and exhaling for the next two.\\n6. **Pace**: Listen to your body and find a sustainable pace. If new to running, consider a walk-run strategy, alternating between one minute of running and one minute of walking.\\n7. **Cool-Down**: Save the last 5-10 minutes for a cool down - slow your running gradually to a walk. End with static stretches focusing on the hamstrings, calves, and quadriceps to prevent soreness.",
