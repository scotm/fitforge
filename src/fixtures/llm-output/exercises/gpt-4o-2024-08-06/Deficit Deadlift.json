  "name": "Deficit Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Place a platform or weight plate on the ground to create a deficit. The platform should be around 1 to 4 inches high, depending on flexibility and experience level. Stand on this platform with feet shoulder-width apart.\n   \n2. **Approach the Bar**: The barbell should be on the ground just in front of your feet and mid-foot. Keep your shins close to the bar without touching it yet.\n   \n3. **Grip the Bar**: Bend at the hips and knees to reach down and grip the barbell with a double overhand grip or mixed grip.\n   \n4. **Position Your Hips**: Lower your hips slightly. Your back should be straight or slightly arched, and your chest should be up and open. \n\n5. **Engage Your Core**: Take a deep breath and brace your core, keeping your spine neutral throughout the lift.\n   \n6. **Lift Off**: Push through your heels and extend your knees and hips simultaneously to lift the bar off the ground. The bar should travel in a straight path as you lift, close to your body.\n   \n7. **Stand Tall**: Continue the motion until you're standing upright with the barbell at hip level, shoulders pushed back for a complete lockout.\n   \n8. **Lower the Bar**: Reverse the motion by hinging at the hips first, then bending the knees as you lower the bar back down to the ground. Maintain control throughout the descent.\n   \n9. **Repeat**: Reset your position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
