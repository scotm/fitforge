  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position:**\n   - Lie flat on your back on the floor or a bench.\n   - Bend your knees and plant your feet flat on the ground or surface.\n   - Hold a barbell or a sturdy stick above your chest with your arms slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, palms facing towards your feet (overhand grip).\n\n2. **Setup:**\n   - Ensure the bar is balanced and held securely with your hands.\n   - Engage your core muscles and maintain a slight natural curve in your lower back.\n\n3. **Execution:**\n   - Pull the bar straight down towards your mid chest only using your arms, stopping when your upper arms are parallel to the floor. This is the starting position for the isometry.\n   - Hold the contraction in your back and arms, maintaining tension without moving the bar.\n   - Keep your back straight and shoulders away from your ears throughout the hold.\n   - Breathe normally and sustain this position for the desired duration, usually between 10 to 30 seconds.\n\n4. **Completion:**\n   - Slowly release the tension by pushing the bar back up to the starting position overhead.\n   - Rest for a moment as needed before repeating for additional sets or repetitions.",
