  "name": "Horizontal Traction Isometry",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Preparation**:\n   - Find a sturdy object such as a table, a horizontal bar, or a low Smith machine bar that can support your weight. Ensure the height of the bar or support is around waist high or adjustable to your comfort level when you lie underneath.\n   \n2. **Setup Position**:\n   - Lie down with your back on the ground underneath the horizontal support (e.g., bar, table edge).\n   - Reach up and grasp the support with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width.\n   - Position your body so that your heels are resting on the floor and your body forms a straight line from your head to your feet. Your torso should be hanging directly under the bar with arms fully extended overhead.\n\n3. **Execution**:\n   - Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body by slightly tucking your pelvis in.\n   - Pull your shoulder blades back and down as if trying to pinch them together, engaging the upper back muscles.\n   - Use your arm strength to pull your chest up towards the bar, maintaining a straight body line from head to heels. Stop when your body forms a 90-degree angle at the elbows and you are off the ground.\n   - Hold this position isometrically by continuing to contract your back muscles. Maintain your chest elevated towards the bar and keep your body steady.\n   - Continue to breathe steadily throughout the hold, focusing on maintaining tension in your upper back and arm muscles.\n\n4. **Duration & Release**:\n   - Hold the isometric contraction for 10 to 30 seconds, depending on your strength and experience level.\n   - To release, slowly lower your body back to the starting position, keeping control of your movement as you extend your arms.\n\n5. **Repeat**:\n   - Rest for 30 seconds to 1 minute between sets.\n   - Aim for 3 to 5 sets, completing the same hold duration each set.\n\n6. **Tips**:\n   - Ensure your body remains in a straight alignment without allowing your hips to sag or your back to arch excessively.\n   - Keep your gaze upwards rather than looking down to maintain a neutral spine.\n   - Focus on squeezing the shoulder blades and engaging the entire back throughout the hold.",
