  "how_to_perform": "1. **Preparation:**\n   - Find a clear wall space where you can safely perform the exercise. Remove any obstructions from the area.\n   - If you're a beginner, place a mat or cushion under your head for added protection.\n\n2. **Starting Position:**\n   - Begin by facing the wall with your feet roughly a foot away from it.\n   - Place your hands on the floor, shoulder-width apart, and ensure your fingers are spread wide for stability.\n   - Kick up into a handstand position by pushing off one foot and swinging your legs up so your heels touch the wall.\n   - Adjust your distance as needed so that your hands are about 6-12 inches from the wall, maintaining a straight line from your hands through your shoulders, hips, and legs.\n   - Keep your core tight to maintain balance.\n\n3. **Performing the Push-Up:**\n   - Slowly bend your elbows, lowering your head towards the floor while keeping your body straight.\n   - Aim to lower your head until it lightly touches the floor or the cushioning.\n   - Avoid flaring your elbows out to the sides; keep them at about a 45-degree angle relative to your body.\n   - Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement.\n\n4. **Returning to Starting Position:**\n   - Press firmly through your hands as you straighten your elbows to push your body back to the starting handstand position.\n   - Ensure your core remains engaged throughout the movement to support your balance.\n\n5. **Safety and Control:**\n   - Descend and ascend slowly to maintain control and prevent injury.\n   - Start with a few repetitions and gradually increase as you gain strength and confidence.\n\n6. **Finishing the Exercise:**\n   - When completed, carefully lower one leg at a time back to the floor, returning to a standing position.\n   - Rest as needed before starting another set or moving on to different exercises.",
