  "name": "Thruster",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell or kettlebell with both hands at shoulder height.\n\n2. **Squat and Press**: \n   - Lower yourself into a squat position by bending your knees. As you reach the bottom of the movement, press upwards through your heels to complete an overhead press.\n\n3. **Full Body Movement**:\n   - The key action of the thruster is that it combines elements of both squats (working the legs) and overhead presses (working the upper body), creating a dynamic full-body exercise.\n\n4. **Aerial Position**: \n   - Briefly pause in an aerial position at the top, with your arms fully extended above you and your weight supported on one leg, or you may choose to keep both feet on the ground if more comfortable.\n\n5. **Controlled Lowering**:\n   - Slowly return to the starting position by lowering yourself through the squat movement, guiding the barbell up your body with control as you descend.\n\n6. **Repeat**: \n   - Perform the movement for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring controlled movements throughout.",
