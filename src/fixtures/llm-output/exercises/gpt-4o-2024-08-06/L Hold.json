  "name": "L Hold",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by sitting on the floor with your legs extended straight in front of you, and your back straight.\n\n2. Place your palms flat on the ground next to your hips. Your fingers should be pointing forward and slightly spread apart for better support.\n\n3. Engage your core muscles by pulling your navel in towards your spine. This will help stabilize your body and lift your legs.\n\n4. Press down firmly through your palms and lift your hips off the ground.\n\n5. Squeeze your quads and keep your legs straight as you lift your feet off the ground. Your body should create an \"L\" shape, with your torso vertical and your legs horizontal and parallel to the ground.\n\n6. Hold this position for as long as you can while breathing deeply. Try to keep your legs as straight as possible without letting them drop.\n\n7. To come down, slowly lower your hips and feet back to the ground, maintaining control.\n\n8. Rest and then repeat for the desired number of sets.",
