  "name": "Shoulder Width Three-Point Push-Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by positioning yourself in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground. The distance between each hand should be equal to the width of one shoulder, and your arms should form an 'L' shape beneath you.\n\n2. Hold the position on your hands and feet, keeping your core engaged for stability. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels.\n\n3. Instead of lowering yourself down by bending at the elbows, focus on decreasing the distance between your chest and the ground by pushing your hips forward and extending your torso.\n\n4. Keep your upper arms still throughout this movement, while allowing your shoulders and chest to move closer to the ground as you push your torso forward.\n\n5. When fully extended, with your shoulders almost touching the ground, hold for a brief moment before returning to the starting position in control.\n\n6. Perform each repetition deliberately and without pause.",
