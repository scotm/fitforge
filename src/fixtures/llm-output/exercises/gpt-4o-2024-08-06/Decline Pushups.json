  "name": "Decline Pushups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Begin by placing a sturdy platform, like a bench or step, behind you.** Ensure that it is at a safe height such that when your feet are elevated, you can maintain a straight line from your head to your heels.\n\n2. **Assume the standard pushup position but with your feet raised.** Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground and place your toes on the elevated platform. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your feet.\n\n3. **Engage your core and keep your body straight.** Avoid sagging or lifting your hips.\n\n4. **Slowly lower your body towards the ground.** Bend your elbows and keep them at a 45-degree angle to your body as you lower yourself. Your chest should approach the ground without touching it.\n\n5. **Push yourself back up to the starting position.** Press through your palms and extend your elbows to return to the plank position with your arms straight.\n\n6. **Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.** Maintain control throughout the movement and focus on using your chest, shoulders, and triceps to complete each pushup.",
