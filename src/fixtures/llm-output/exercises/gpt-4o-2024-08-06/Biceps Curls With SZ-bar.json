  "name": "Biceps Curls With SZ-bar",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Grasp the SZ bar (also known as an EZ curl bar) with an underhand grip (palms facing up), hands spaced about shoulder-width apart. Keeping your back straight, hold the bar at arm's length against your thighs.\n\n2. **Curl the Bar**: Slowly raise the SZ-bar by bending your elbows and bringing your forearms up, trying to keep your elbows close to your body. Avoid swinging your body or using momentum to lift the bar.\n\n3. **Contract**: Raise the bar until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Pause briefly at the top of the lift, squeezing your biceps tightly.\n\n4. **Lower the Bar**: Lower the bar back to the starting position in a controlled manner, unbending your elbows and extending your arms fully. Maintain control of the bar to maximize muscle engagement.\n\n5. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, typically 8-12 reps for muscle growth.\n\n6. **Breathe**: Exhale as you lift the bar and inhale as you lower it.",
