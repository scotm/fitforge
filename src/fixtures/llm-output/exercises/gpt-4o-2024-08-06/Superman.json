  "how_to_perform": "* Hold a weight or barbell with your hands shoulder-width apart, and your body in a straight line from head to heels. This is the starting position.\n* Lower your upper body down towards the ground by bending at the hips, keeping your arms straight. Your hands should remain above the ground. Keep your lower back flat and your core muscles engaged throughout.\n* As you lower down, focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together. Hold this position for a brief moment to emphasize activation in your shoulders and upper back. This is not just a matter of lowering yourself down; it's about engaging your supporting muscles, especially the rhomboids and traps.\n* Slowly return to the starting position by straightening your arms. Repeat the motion for the desired number of repetitions.",
