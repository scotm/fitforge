  "name": "Power Clean",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, with a barbell on the ground close to your shins, over the balls of your feet. Bend your knees slightly and hinge at your hips to lower your torso and grasp the bar with an overhand grip, your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your back should be straight, chest up, and your head in a neutral position looking forward. Engage your core muscles.\\n\\n2. **First Pull**: Begin the movement by driving through your heels and extending your knees and hips. The bar should rise vertically close to your body. Keep your arms straight and shoulders above or slightly in front of the bar. This phase of the lift aims to generate upward momentum on the bar.\\n\\n3. **Second Pull (Power Phase)**: As the bar passes your knees, explosively extend your hips and knees. Simultaneously, shrug your shoulders and pull yourself under the bar by bending your elbows. The triple extension (hips, knees, and ankles) here is crucial for translating power to the barbell.\\n\\n4. **Catch**: As the bar reaches its highest point, rotate your elbows around and under it quickly, allowing yourself to drop into a quarter squat position to \"catch\" the bar on the front of your shoulders. Your elbows should point forward with your upper arms parallel to the ground, and your wrists flexible, securing the barbell.\\n\\n5. **Recovery**: Stand up from the quarter squat position by extending your hips and knees to full standing. This completes the lift.\\n\\n6. **Reset**: Carefully lower the bar back to the floor in a controlled manner, ensuring you maintain good posture, or drop it safely according to your gym's guidelines (typically if using bumper plates).",
