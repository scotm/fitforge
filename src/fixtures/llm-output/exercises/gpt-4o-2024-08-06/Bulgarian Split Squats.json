  "name": "Bulgarian Split Squat",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Stand a couple of feet in front of a bench or a sturdy elevated surface with your back facing it. The bench should be about knee height.\n\n2. **Positioning:** Lift one of your legs off the ground and place the top of your foot on the bench behind you. Your standing leg should be far enough forward so when you squat down, your knee doesn't extend far beyond your toes. \n\n3. **Balance:** Find your balance in this position. Your feet should be about hip-width apart from side to side in order to maintain stability.\n\n4. **Execution:** With your chest up and core engaged, lower yourself by bending your standing leg. Your back knee should drop down toward the ground. Go as low as you comfortably can or until your thigh is parallel to the floor, ensuring that your front knee stays aligned over your foot.\n\n5. **Ascent:** Push through your front heel to rise back to the starting position, straightening the standing leg. Focus on using your quadriceps and engaging your glutes during this movement.\n\n6. **Repetition:** Repeat the movement for the desired number of reps.\n\n7. **Switch Legs:** Once you have completed the repetitions on one leg, switch to the opposite leg and repeat the same number of reps.\n\n8. **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower yourself and exhale as you push back up.\n\n9. **Angles and Core Engagement:** Keep your upper body straight and core tight throughout the exercise to avoid leaning forward too much.",
