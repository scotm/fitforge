  "name": "Cross-Bench Dumbbell Pullover",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Place a dumbbell vertically on the floor at the end of a flat bench. Sit perpendicular to the bench with your upper back resting on the bench, your feet flat on the floor, and your knees bent at a 90-degree angle.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Grasp the dumbbell with both hands. Keep your hands in a diamond shape (forming a triangle) and wrap your thumbs and fingers around the handle of the dumbbell so that your palms are facing upwards.\n\n3. **Starting Position**: Hold the dumbbell over your chest with your arms extended but slightly bent at the elbows. Your upper back and shoulders should be resting on the bench, while your core is engaged, and your hips are slightly lower than shoulder level.\n\n4. **Lowering the Dumbbell**: Inhale and slowly lower the dumbbell in an arc over and beyond your head until you feel a stretch in your chest and lats. Keep your torso stable and avoid ‘dropping’ your hips.\n\n5. **Lifting the Dumbbell**: Exhale and pull the dumbbell back over your chest along the same arc path, engaging your chest and lats, and returning to the starting position.\n\n6. **Repetition**: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, typically between 8-12, and maintain a controlled rhythm throughout the movement.\n\n7. **Finishing the Exercise**: Carefully bring the dumbbell back over your chest, and with control, lower it to the floor before sitting up and stepping off the bench.",
