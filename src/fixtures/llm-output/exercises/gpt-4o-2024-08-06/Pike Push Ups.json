  "name": "Pike Push Ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start in the Pike Position:** Begin on all fours on the ground. Lift your hips up toward the ceiling, keeping your legs straight, so that your body forms an inverted 'V' shape, similar to a downward dog position in yoga. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your feet should be hip-width apart.\n2. **Hand and Foot Placement:** Make sure your hands are firmly planted on the ground, fingers spread for better support. Your head should be aligned between your arms, looking at your feet.\n3. **Lower into the Push Up:** Lower your upper body towards the ground by bending your elbows. Focus on lowering the top of your head towards the ground rather than your forehead. Keep your elbows flaring out slightly (45 degrees from your body) during this motion.\n4. **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower your head towards the ground.\n5. **Press Back Up:** Once your head is close to the ground (or in a position safe for your flexibility and strength), push through your hands and extend your elbows to press your upper body back to the starting position. Your hips should remain raised throughout the movement.\n6. **Breathing:** Exhale as you push back up to the starting position.\n7. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout.",
