  "how_to_perform": "# Split Squats Right: Exercise Instructions\n1. **Step Positioning**: Stand with your feet wide apart, with one foot stepping forward (right in this case) about two to three times the width of your hip. This will be your forward foot.\n2. **Back Foot Positioning**: Place your back foot a stride behind your front foot and slightly more than shoulder-width. Keep it straight but not locked.\n3. **Starting Position**:\n   - Lower your body down into a lunge position, starting by bending your leading leg (your front right foot). \n   - Lower yourself under control until your forward knee (knee in front of your forward foot) almost touches the ground.\n4. **Controlled Movement**: Take note: As you lower down into this deep squat, keep your back straight and engage your core for stability.\n5. **Pause**: Briefly pause at the lowest point to maintain proper form. Then slowly press out of that lunge position using both legs together in equal measure.\n6. **Return To Start**:\n    Once back up (and ready for repetition), transition carefully towards a standing position again and begin another repetition, aiming for smooth movement control throughout.",

It's an excellent unilateral strengthening exercise that can be completed with the help of body weight alone.",
