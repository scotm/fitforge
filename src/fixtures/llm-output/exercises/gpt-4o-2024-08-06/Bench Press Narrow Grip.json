  "name": "Narrow Grip Bench Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up**: \n   - Lie back on a flat bench with a barbell in the rack above you. \n   - Adjust the bar so that it is at the correct height, which should be such that you can comfortably unrack it with straight wrists without moving your shoulders. \n   - Place your feet flat on the floor with your knees bent at a comfortable angle.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar**: \n   - Use a narrow grip, typically shoulder-width or slightly closer. Your hands should be no more than 12 to 18 inches apart, depending on your comfort and body mechanics. \n   - Ensure your thumbs wrap around the bar for a secure grip.\n\n3. **Unrack the Bar**: \n   - Extend your arms, pushing the bar out of the rack until it is above your chest. Keep your elbows locked and ensure the bar is stabilized.\n\n4. **Perform the Press**: \n   - Inhale deeply and begin lowering the bar steadily to your lower chest or sternum. \n   - Keep your elbows tucked at around a 45-degree angle to your body throughout the movement. \n   - Avoid flaring your elbows out to maintain tension in your triceps and prevent shoulder strain.\n\n5. **Press the Bar Back Up**: \n   - Press the bar back up by extending your elbows, focusing on using your triceps to drive the movement. \n   - Exhale as you push and lock your elbows at the top without overextending your arms.\n\n6. **Repeat**: \n   - Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining proper form and focus on your triceps throughout the set.\n\n7. **Rerack the Bar**: \n   - Carefully guide the bar back into the rack by extending your arms fully until they are directly over the rack hooks. Then, gently lower the bar into place. Make sure it is securely in the rack before releasing your grip.",
