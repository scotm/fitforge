  "name": "Cross-Bench Dumbbell Pullover",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Equipment Setup**: You'll need a dumbbell for this exercise. Choose a weight that is appropriate for your strength level. You should also have access to a flat exercise bench.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Lie across a bench, with only your upper back and shoulders supported by the bench. Your hips should remain lower than your upper body, and your feet should be firmly planted on the ground to provide balance. Grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it above your chest with your arms extended.\n\n3. **Hand Position**: Your hands should be positioned under the upper plate of the dumbbell, with your thumbs and fingers wrapped around the handle securely.\n\n4. **Core Engagement**: Engage your core muscles to stabilize your torso and maintain control throughout the exercise.\n\n5. **Movement Execution**: Slowly lower the dumbbell in an arc backward over your head and towards the floor. Keep your elbows slightly bent and fixed in position; the movement should be primarily occurring at your shoulder joints.\n\n6. **Breathing**: Inhale deeply as you lower the dumbbell behind you, and exhale as you bring it back to the starting position.\n\n7. **Return to Start**: Once the dumbbell is at the farthest point, pull it back over your head to the starting position, using the same controlled manner. Focus on using your chest and lats to lift the weight.\n\n8. **Repetitions and Sets**: Aim for 8-12 repetitions per set, completing 3-4 sets based on your fitness level.\n\n9. **Safety Tips**: Ensure that your head is supported and avoid arching your lower back excessively. Keep the movement slow and controlled to prevent any strain or injury.",
