  "name": "Close-grip Lat Pulldown",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Machine**: Start by adjusting the seat height so that when sitting, your feet are flat on the floor and the tops of your thighs are snug under the thigh pads. \n\n2. **Choose the Proper Handle**: Attach a close-grip handle (V-bar) or a parallel grip handle to the lat pulldown machine. Ensure the attachment is secure.\n\n3. **Select the Weight**: Adjust the weight on the machine to a suitable level. If you are new, start with a lighter weight to ensure proper form before increasing the load.\n\n4. **Sit in Position**: Sit down, firmly pressing your feet into the ground, and secure your thighs under the support pads.\n\n5. **Grip the Handle**: Reach up and grab the handle with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart.\n\n6. **Engage Your Core**: Sit up straight or with a slight lean back, engage your core, and keep your chest up. \n\n7. **Pull Down the Bar**: Begin the exercise by pulling the handle down towards your upper chest, leading with your elbows. Your elbows should move downward and backward.\n\n8. **Focus on Your Back**: As you pull down, squeeze your shoulder blades together and feel the contraction in your lat muscles. Avoid using your biceps as the primary movers.\n\n9. **Control the Movement**: Pause briefly when the handle is at your chest level, then slowly and in a controlled manner, let the bar rise back to the starting position as you extend your arms, feeling a stretch in your lats.\n\n10. **Breathing**: Exhale as you pull the handle down and inhale as you return to the starting position.\n\n11. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions with good form, usually between 8-12 per set for strength or 12-15 for muscle endurance. Complete 3-4 sets.",
