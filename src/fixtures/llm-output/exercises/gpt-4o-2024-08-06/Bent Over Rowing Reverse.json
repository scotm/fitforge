  "how_to_perform": "1. **Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent.** Keep your core engaged to maintain balance and support your lower back.\n\n2. **Hold a dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms facing each other).** Ensure the weights are manageable, allowing you to maintain form throughout the exercise.\n\n3. **Bend forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your chest up.** Your torso should be at about a 45-degree angle to the floor.\n\n4. **Maintain a slight bend in your knees.** This helps stabilize your body and protect your lower back.\n\n5. **Extend your arms straight down towards the floor, keeping the dumbbells parallel to each other.** Ensure your head and neck are in a neutral position, aligned with your spine.\n\n6. **Pull the dumbbells towards your lower chest by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.** Avoid swinging the weights or using momentum; the motion should be controlled.\n\n7. **Pause briefly at the top of the movement, feeling the contraction in your upper back.** Focus on keeping your core tight and your back straight.\n\n8. **Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.** Maintain control over the weights as you extend your arms forward.\n\n9. **Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.** Aim for 8-12 reps per set, adjusting weight as needed to maintain correct form.",
