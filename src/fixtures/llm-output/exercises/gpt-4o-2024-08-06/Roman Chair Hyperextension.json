  "name": "Roman Chair Hyperextension",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by adjusting the Roman chair so that the top of the pad is resting just above your hip bones. Your feet should be secured under the foot pads.\n\n2. Position your body on the Roman chair. Your thighs rest on the main pad, and your ankles are locked in by the foot pads. Your torso should be able to hang free. Cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your head.\n\n3. Begin with your upper body in a straight line with your legs, maintaining a neutral spine and keeping your core engaged. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.\n\n4. Slowly lower your upper body towards the ground by bending at the hips, keeping your movements controlled. Lower until your body is just past parallel to the ground, or until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings.\n\n5. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement.\n\n6. Raise your torso back to the starting position by contracting your lower back muscles, glutes, and hamstrings. Be careful not to arch your back too much at the top.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining steady and controlled movements throughout.",
