  "name": "Leg Raises, Lying",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie down on your back on a mat or a comfortable, flat surface. Keep your legs straight and together. Let your arms rest at your sides, palms facing down.\n\n2. Press your lower back into the floor to engage your core. Keep this engagement throughout the exercise to prevent your back from arching excessively.\n\n3. Keeping your legs straight, slowly lift them towards the ceiling. Lift until your legs are perpendicular to your torso or as high as you can without compromising your back position.\n\n4. Hold the top position for a brief moment while maintaining core engagement.\n\n5. Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position, making sure your lower back stays pressed against the floor. Do not let your feet touch the ground; keep them a few inches above it.\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring controlled and smooth movements for each lift and lowering phase.",
