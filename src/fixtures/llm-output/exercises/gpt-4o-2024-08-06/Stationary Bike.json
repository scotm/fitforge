  "name": "Stationary Bike",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Saddle Height**:\n   Choose a comfortable seat height where you can maintain a slight bend in your knee with the pedal at its lowest point.\n2. **Starting Position**: \n   Sit on the stationary bike, ensuring the pedals are at their lowest position and your feet are secured properly into the pedal straps.\n3. **Pedaling Motion**:\n   Start pedaling, remembering to keep an efficient pedal rotation throughout the entire stroke cycle using your legs rather than just bouncing up and down with a minimal movement that skips over any true strength engagement.\n\n4. **Breathing Control**: \n   Breathe naturally, not holding your breath or taking uneven deep breaths, to avoid hyperventilation during exercise.\n\n5. **Continuous Pedaling**:\n   Continue pedaling at the desired tempo, whether it be in resistance mode for a specified interval and then followed by active recovery time without pedaling for some minutes (or 2 sets of alternating cycling with 3-minutes rest between) or doing low intensity steady-state sessions. The choice is fully yours based on the purpose of your workout (either cardio endurance training, building general muscular strength via this cycling activity, or merely a more leisurely pace for pure mental clarity).\n\n6. **Cool Down**:\n   End with a controlled cool-down session where you cycle at a minimal speed. This helps gradually return your body to its resting state",
