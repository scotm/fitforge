  "name": "Side-lying External Rotation",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Lie on Your Side**: \n   Lie down on a flat surface with your side facing upwards and your legs straight together.\n   Engage your core muscles for stability throughout the exercise.\n\n2. **Starting Position**:\n   - Let one leg rest on the floor in front of the other. This creates a fulcrum point to aid in stabilizing you during the movement.\n\n3. **Hold Your Top Arm**: \n   Lift your top arm and let it hang straight down past that side.\n\n4. **Movement Initiation**:\n   To perform the external rotation, take your top arm from hanging vertically downwards along your side to outwards away from your body, without rotating your entire upper body.\n\n5. **Continue Movement Till Completion**: \n   Rotate your shoulder until your top forearm is almost parallel with your feet position at the base of your legs (but not quite touching).\n\n6. **Repeat With The Other Arm**:\n    Perform this movement for a few repetitions on each side to balance out the use on both arms.",
