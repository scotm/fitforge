  "name": "Dumbbells on Preacher Bench",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Preacher Bench**: Adjust the height of the preacher bench so that when you sit, your arms are comfortably resting on the padding and the back of your upper arms are firmly against the bench. Your elbows should not hang over the edge.\n\n2. **Select Your Dumbbells**: Choose a pair of dumbbells with a weight that allows you to perform the exercise with proper form through the entire set.\n\n3. **Starting Position**: Sit down on the preacher bench and grip a dumbbell in each hand using an underhand, or supine, grip. Your arms should be extended over the bench but with a slight bend in your elbows to prevent joint locking.\n\n4. **Curl the Dumbbells**: Keeping your upper arms stationary, curl the weights upward by flexing at the elbow. Focus on contracting the biceps as you perform the motion. Continue curling until your forearms are vertical or the dumbbells are a few inches away from your shoulders.\n\n5. **Pause and Squeeze**: At the top of the movement, pause for a moment and squeeze your biceps tightly.\n\n6. **Lower the Dumbbells**: Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position by extending your arms. Maintain control of the dumbbells throughout the descent to work on the negative part of the exercise.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining control and proper form.\n\n8. **Safety Tip**: Avoid using momentum to swing the weights up. All movement should come from the biceps, minimizing any shoulder involvement.",
