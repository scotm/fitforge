Engage your core to maintain a neutral spine.\n\n4. **Row the Barbell**: Inhale, then exhale as you explosively pull the barbell towards your torso, aiming to touch your lower chest or upper stomach. Keep your elbows close to your body throughout the movement.\n\n5. **Lower the Barbell**: Inhale as you lower the bar back to the floor in a controlled manner, resetting your position each time. Ensure the barbell comes to a complete stop on the floor before starting the next rep.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining good form and control with each lift.\n\n7. **Finishing**: Once you complete your set, carefully set the barbell back on the floor.",
