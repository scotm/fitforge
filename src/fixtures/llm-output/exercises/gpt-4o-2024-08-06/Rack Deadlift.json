  "name": "Rack Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting up a barbell on a squat or power rack at knee height. Adjust the safety pins if necessary to ensure the bar does not go lower than your knees.\n\n2. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outward. Position yourself so your shins are close to the bar.\n\n3. Bend at the hips and knees, maintaining a neutral spine, and grip the barbell with both hands just outside your knees. Use either an overhand grip (palms facing towards you) or a mixed grip (one palm facing towards you and the other away).\n\n4. Before lifting, engage your core, keep your back flat, and retract your shoulder blades slightly.\n\n5. Push through your heels, extend your hips and knees, and lift the bar by standing up straight. Keep the bar close to your body as you lift.\n\n6. Once you reach a standing position, lock out your hips by fully extending them and squeezing your glutes.\n\n7. Hold the bar at the top for a moment, then reverse the movement by pushing your hips back first followed by bending your knees. Lower the bar back onto the rack, maintaining control throughout and keeping your back straight.\n\n8. Reset your position and repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
