  "name": "Close-grip Lat Pulldown",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by sitting down on a lat pulldown machine. Adjust the knee pads so that they fit snugly on top of your thighs. This will help you stabilize your body during the exercise.\n\n2. Reach up and grasp the lat pulldown bar with an underhand grip (palms facing you) and hands close together, about shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. Lean back slightly and engage your core. Your chest should be up and your back straight.\n\n4. Begin the movement by pulling the bar down towards your upper chest, drawing your elbows in towards your torso. Focus on engaging your lats as you pull down.\n\n5. Continue to pull the bar down until it reaches just below your chin level. Hold this position for a brief second while squeezing your shoulder blades together.\n\n6. Slowly release the tension and allow the bar to rise back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control and form throughout the exercise.",
