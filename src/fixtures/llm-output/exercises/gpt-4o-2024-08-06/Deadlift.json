  "name": "Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Stand with your mid-foot under the barbell. Your feet should be about hip-width apart, toes slightly angled out.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar:** Bend over and grasp the bar with a grip slightly outside of your legs. Use either a double overhand grip or a mixed grip (one hand facing down, the other up) for heavy weights.\n\n3. **Position Your Body:** Bend your knees until your shins touch the bar. Keep your back straight as you do this, making sure your hips don't dip too low.\n\n4. **Engage Your Core:** Take a deep breath, fill your belly with air, and brace your core. Your back should be flat or slightly arched.\n\n5. **Lift the Bar:** Stand up straight by pushing your feet into the ground while extending your hips and knees. Pull the bar up, keeping it close to your legs.\n\n6. **Stand Tall:** At the top of the lift, your shoulders should be back, chest up, and hips fully extended.\n\n7. **Lower the Bar:** Push your hips back first, then bend your knees to lower the bar back to the ground under control, maintaining a flat back.\n\n8. **Reset:** Once the barbell is back on the ground, take a moment to reset your core and grip before performing the next repetition.",
