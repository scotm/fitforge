  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up**: Begin by placing a barbell at about shoulder height in a squat rack. Load the desired weight plates onto the barbell.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Stand facing the barbell and position yourself under it with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Place the barbell across your upper back, resting on your traps or rear deltoids.\n\n3. **Grip the Bar**: Grasp the bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your elbows should point down and your chest should be upright.\n\n4. **Unrack the Bar**: Lift the bar off the rack by pushing up with your legs and stepping backwards. Make sure the bar is stable on your shoulders.\n\n5. **Foot Stance**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly pointed outwards.\n\n6. **Initiate the Squat**: Begin the squat by bending at the knees and hips simultaneously. Keep your back straight and chest up. Look forward.\n\n7. **Lowering**: Lower your body as if you are sitting back into a chair. Your knees should track over your toes. Descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground or lower if comfortable.\n\n8. **Ascending**: Push through your heels to stand back up, extending your knees and hips. Keep your chest up and back straight.\n\n9. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower down and exhale as you push back up.\n\n10. **Re-Rack the Bar**: Once you have completed your set, carefully step forward and place the bar back onto the rack, ensuring it is secure.",
