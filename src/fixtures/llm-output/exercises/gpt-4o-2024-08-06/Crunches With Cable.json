Grasp the rope with both hands and position your hands at the sides of your head or slightly in front, maintaining a firm grip.\n4. Step back slightly to create tension in the cable and adjust distance from the machine so your body leans slightly forward.\n5. Engage your core and keep your hips stationary as you begin the movement.\n6. Exhale and pull with your abs, rounding your back and bringing your chest toward your knees. Hold briefly at the contraction point.\n7. Inhale and slowly return to the starting position with control, not allowing the weights to touch the stack.\n8. Repeat for the desired number of reps, maintaining focus on using your abdominal muscles to execute the movement.",
