  "name": "Lat Pull Down (Leaning Back)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Sit down at a lat pull-down machine. Position yourself so that your feet are flat on the floor, your thighs are secured under the support pads, and your body is stable. Adjust the support pads as necessary to ensure a snug fit.\n\n2. Reach up and grab the bar with a pronated (overhand) grip, your hands positioned wider than shoulder-width apart. Depending on your preference or the type of bar, you can use a slightly wider grip if comfortable.\n\n3. Before pulling the bar down, lean slightly back at the hips, engaging your core and maintaining a neutral spine position. Your torso should be reclined at about a 70-75 degree angle from the bench.\n\n4. Begin the exercise by pulling your shoulder blades down and back, initiating the movement from your shoulders rather than your arms. Focus on keeping your elbows pointed downwards.\n\n5. Exhale as you pull the bar down towards the upper part of your chest. Be careful not to jerk the weightâ€”perform the motion in a controlled manner.\n\n6. Squeeze your shoulder blades together at the bottom of the movement and hold for a brief moment, ensuring you do not pull past your chest to avoid unnecessary shoulder strain.\n\n7. Inhale as you slowly release the bar back to the starting position, allowing your arms to fully extend upwards while maintaining the slight recline in your posture.\n\n8. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, keeping the motion smooth and controlled throughout.",
