  "name": "Incline Push-Ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Find a sturdy, elevated surface such as a bench, a step, or an incline board. The higher the surface, the easier the exercise.\n\n2. Place your hands on the edge of the elevated surface slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Make sure your fingers are pointed forward and your palms are flat on the surface.\n\n3. Walk your feet backward until your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Your arms should be fully extended.\n\n4. Engage your core muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. This will help keep your body in a straight line.\n\n5. Begin the movement by bending your elbows and lowering your chest toward the elevated surface. Keep your elbows at approximately a 45-degree angle to your body.\n\n6. Lower yourself until your chest nearly touches the surface, or as far as you are comfortable without compromising your form.\n\n7. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement.\n\n8. Push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position. Be sure to keep your body in a straight line throughout the movement and avoid letting your hips sag.\n\n9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
