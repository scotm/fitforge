  "name": "Overhead Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up**: Begin by selecting an appropriate weight on a barbell or a pair of dumbbells. For barbells, use a squat rack to position the barbell at slightly below shoulder height.\n\n2. **Grip**: Stand facing the barbell, place your hands on the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. If using dumbbells, hold them at shoulder height with palms facing forward or towards your face.\n\n3. **Unrack the Bar**: If using a barbell, step under the barbell so it rests across your upper chest and front shoulders. Keep your elbows slightly in front of the bar, engage your core, and then lift the bar off the rack by extending your knees and hips.\n\n4. **Stance**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed forward. Maintain a slight bend in your knees for stability.\n\n5. **Position**: Keep your core tight, chest up, and gaze forward. Ensure that your forearms are vertical when viewed from the side. This is your starting position.\n\n6. **Press**: Before starting the lift, take a deep breath, brace your core, and drive the weight upwards by extending your arms fully overhead. Keep your head stable and slightly tuck your chin as the barbell or dumbbells pass your face.\n\n7. **Lockout**: At the top of the movement, your arms should be straight with the weight directly over your mid-foot. Avoid locking your elbows too forcefully. Ensure your body remains stable, with minimal arch in the lower back.\n\n8. **Lower**: Lower the barbell or dumbbells back down with control to the starting position, keeping your elbows slightly in front and ensuring not to flare them too far outwards.\n\n9. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control of the weight throughout each rep.\n\n10. **Finish and Rack**: Once complete, if using a barbell, carefully step back to the rack and lower the bar onto the hooks while maintaining your grip until the bar is secure. With dumbbells, gently set them down or bring them safely to your sides and then place them down.",
