  "name": "Squat Jumps",
  "how_to_perform": "* Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Make sure your knees are behind the plane of your toes and your weight is evenly distributed between both legs.\n* Keep your back straight, engaging your core to engage your lower abs and supporting stability in the movement.\n* Lower yourself down into a deep squatting position while keeping some tension in your muscles throughout. Your upper body should stay relaxed and straight, looking forward at about a slight angle to allow optimal positioning for squatting.\n* Explode upward from that low position using only your legs. Keep your arms loose but in front of you to maintain stability and control as you go up into the air.\n* The motion described will be fast-paced, where your body leaves the ground on an upward trajectory and you can land softly back down in a squatting or lower-down position.*\n* Land safely back into a mid-range squat after exploding upwards. Absorb the landing by flexing at multiple joints to save energy and maintain stability throughout.",
  "short_summary": "Squat Jumps is a plyometric exercise focused primarily on the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back muscles with minimal focus on other areas like upper body due to keeping body straight during jumps.",
