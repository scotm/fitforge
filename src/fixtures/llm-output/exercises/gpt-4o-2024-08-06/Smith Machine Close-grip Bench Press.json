  "how_to_perform": "# Smith Machine Close-grip Bench Press\n1. Set the Smith machine to a comfortable height for your body.\n\n## Starting Position\n* Lie down on a flat bench, gripping the bar with an overhand grip that is closer together than shoulder-width apart. Your hands should be slightly wider apart than shoulder-width apart if you were doing a standard close-grip bench press without the smith machine.\n* Pull your shoulders down and away from your ears, engage your core, and maintain a straight line from head to heels.\n\n## Initial Movement\n* Slowly and smoothly lower the bar down to your chest while keeping your elbows slightly bent. Use your body's entire mass to help you lift the weight; if you can only lift it with your arms, it may be too heavy.\n* Maintain proper body positioning throughout the range of motion.",
