  "name": "Long-Pulley (low Row)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Seat and Footplate**: Begin by sitting on the seat and placing your feet on the footplate in front of you. Adjust the seat or footplate so that your knees are slightly bent and you can comfortably reach the pulley handle. Your back should be straight and perpendicular to the ground.\n\n2. **Grasp the Handle**: Lean forward slightly from your hips, keeping your back straight, and grasp the handle. The handle is usually attached to a cable. Ensure your palms are facing each other or facing down, depending on the handle type.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your torso. Your chest should be up, and shoulders back.\n\n4. **Pull the Handle**: Begin the rowing motion by pulling the handle towards your lower abdomen. Keep your elbows close to your body as you row back. As you pull, squeeze your shoulder blades together. Do not lean too far back.\n\n5. **Return to Starting Position**: Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, allowing the handle to move back to the origin while maintaining control of the weight. Keep your back straight and don't hunch your shoulders forward.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining a smooth, controlled motion throughout the exercise.",
