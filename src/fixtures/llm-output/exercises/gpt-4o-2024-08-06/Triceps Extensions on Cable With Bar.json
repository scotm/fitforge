  "name": "Triceps Extensions on Cable With Bar",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Equipment Setup**:\n   - Locate a cable machine with a bar attachment.\n   - Adjust the height of the cable so that when you are in position, your arms will be fully extended and in line with your upper body.\n\n2. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand facing the cable machine with the bar at chest level or slightly higher. Make sure the bar is secure and stable under the weight.\n   - Grip the bar firmly with an overhand shoulder-width grip ( palms facing down) .\n   - Keep your core engaged, posture upright and feet shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n3. **Lowering the Bar**:\n   - Slowly lower the bar downwards in front of your thighs. This movement should start when your arms are fully extended overhead.\n   - Focus on contracting the triceps muscles while extending your elbows to control the weight's descent.\n\n4. **Lower Position**:\n   - Continue lowering the bar until it reaches or breaks the mid-frontal plane (nearly parallel to the floor, without touching). Ensure that your upper arm is almost parallel to the ground and only the forearm remains perpendicular.\n   - Pause for a moment in this position to maintain focus on the contraction.\n\n5. **Extension**:\n   - Now push the weight back upwards towards the ceiling using your triceps muscles.\n   - As the bar ascends, keep your elbows close to the body and avoid arching your lower back or leaning forward excessively.\n   - Avoid locking your elbows at the top of the movement as it may put unnecessary strain on your joints.\n\n6. **Repetition**:\n   - Repeat this range of motion for a predetermined number of times â€“ depending on the training session plan. Keep control and emphasis on using the triceps for lifting.",
