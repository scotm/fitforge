  "name": "Pendlay Row",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Let’s Set the Stage**: Place a loaded barbell on the floor in front of you. Ensure it’s a weight you’re comfortable lifting. Stand with your midfoot underneath the barbell, feet about hip-width apart.\\n\\n2. **Get Into Position**: Bend at your hips and knees, keeping your back straight, until you can grasp the barbell with an overhand grip (palms facing down). Your grip should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\\n\\n3. **Proper Posture**: Adjust your body so your torso is parallel to the floor. Your shins should be nearly vertical and your shoulders slightly ahead of the bar. Keep your head in a neutral position, looking at a spot on the ground about a foot in front of you.\\n\\n4. **Tighten Up**: Engage your core, and retract your shoulder blades back and down. This will promote good posture and help you lift more effectively.\\n\\n5. **The Lift**: Pull the barbell explosively towards your lower chest or upper stomach, focusing on keeping your elbows out to the side and squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Your torso should remain stable without rising too much during the lift.\\n\\n6. **Return with Control**: Lower the barbell back to the ground in a controlled manner. This completes one rep. Ensure your lower back remains flat and does not round during the descent.\\n\\n7. **Repeat**: Reset for each repetition, letting the barbell come to a dead stop on the ground to maintain the integrity of each lift. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
