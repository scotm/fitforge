Hold the barbell with a pronated (overhand) grip about shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be fully extended, with the bar over your upper chest.\n4. **Prepare to Lower the Weight**: Keep your elbows pointed towards the ceiling and fixed in position. Keep your upper arms stationary throughout the movement.\n5. **Lower the Barbell**: Slowly bend your elbows to lower the barbell towards your forehead. As you do this, be sure to keep your wrists straight and elbows steady.\n6. **Stop Before Contact**: Stop just short of letting the barbell touch your forehead or slightly above your head.\n7. **Return to Starting Position**: Push through your triceps to extend your elbows and return the barbell back overhead to the starting position.
