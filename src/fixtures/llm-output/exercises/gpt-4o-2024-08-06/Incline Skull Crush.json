Your feet should be flat on the floor.\n\n3. Take a pair of dumbbells and hold them with an overhand grip above your chest, arms fully extended. This is your starting position.\n\n4.

Stop just before the dumbbells reach your forehead. Your elbows should remain pointed towards the ceiling, with the movement primarily occurring at the elbows.\n\n6.

Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form at all times.",
