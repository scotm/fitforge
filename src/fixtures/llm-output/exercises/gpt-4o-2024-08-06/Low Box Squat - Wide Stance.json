  "name": "Low Box Squat - Wide Stance",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting up a sturdy box or platform that is low enough for your thighs to be parallel to the floor or slightly below parallel when you sit on it. \n2. Stand in front of the box with a wide stance. Your feet should be wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outward. \n3. If you are using a barbell, position it on your traps or upper back, using an overhand grip that is a little wider than shoulder width. \n4. Engage your core muscles by taking a deep breath and bracing your abdomen as if you were about to be punched. \n5. Keeping your chest up and your back straight, begin the descent by bending at the hips and knees simultaneously. Make sure to push your knees outwards and keep your weight on your heels as you lower yourself.\n6. Continue lowering your body until you are sitting fully on the box. Pause briefly, ensuring your muscles are engaged and not relaxed. This brief pause can enhance explosive power when returning to the standing position. \n7. Push through your heels and drive your knees outward as you ascend, using your glute and hip muscles to propel yourself back to the starting position. Ensure that your chest remains up and your back stays straight throughout the movement. \n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
