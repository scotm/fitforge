  "name": "Chin-Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by grasping the pull-up bar with an underhand grip. Your palms should be facing you and hands shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Hang at arm's length from the bar. Your arms should be fully extended, and your body is in a straight line. This is often called a dead hang position.\n\n3. Engage your core by slightly drawing in your navel towards your spine. Keep your shoulders back and down.\n\n4. Initiate the pull by squeezing your shoulder blades together and then pulling your body upwards towards the bar.\n\n5. As you lift, focus on pulling through your biceps and lats, bringing your chin up above the level of the bar.\n\n6. Pause momentarily at the top of the movement for a brief second.\n\n7. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position with control until your arms are fully extended again.\n\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
