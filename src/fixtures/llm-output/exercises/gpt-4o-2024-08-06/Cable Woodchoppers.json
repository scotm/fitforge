  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting a cable machine to the highest setting, using either a single handle or rope attachment.\n\n2. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, side on to the machine, and grasp the handle with both hands.\n\n3. Engage your core and start with your arms extended towards the cable machine. Rotate your torso away from the machine as you bring the cable downwards across your body from high to low, in a controlled chopping motion.\n\n4. Allow your hips to pivot and your back foot to rotate slightly as you pull the cable downwards across your body.\n\n5. Focus on keeping your arms straight and your elbows slightly flexed as you bring the cable across. Rotate your torso and engage your core muscles throughout the movement.\n\n6. Slowly return to the starting position by reversing the motion, maintaining tension in the cable.\n\n7. Perform the desired number of repetitions, then switch sides to work both sides of your body evenly.",
