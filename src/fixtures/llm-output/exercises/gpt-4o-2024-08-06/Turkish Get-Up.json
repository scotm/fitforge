  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Begin by lying on your back with one leg straight and the other bent at a 90-degree angle. Place the foot of the lifted leg near the knee of the lowered leg.\n\n2. **Engaging Core**: \n   - Engage your core muscles to support your body as you get up.\n\n3. **Lifting Movement**:\n   - Slowly lift your head, shoulders and upper back off the ground while keeping your lower back pressed into the mat or surface beneath you.\n   - Continue lifting until your arms are straight and holding the weight (if any) used for dumbbells.\n\n4. **Weight Placement**: \n   - If using dumbbells, take hold of them with both hands as you lift up to a standing position, ensuring they balance at eye level.\n\n5. **Getting Up**:\n   - In a controlled motion, balance and then get into a standing position while keeping your core engaged for stability.\n   - Ensure the weight (if any) is stable under your control.\n\n6. **Returning Down**: \n   - With control, slowly bring yourself back down to the ground in an inverted sequence. Begin at the top returning arm to being beside you on the ground.\n\n7. **Weight Placement and Return**: \n   - If weights were used, lower them first by letting them fall back onto the ground beside you as you go through the return motion.\n\n8. **Finishing Position**: \n   - Land softly on both knees once back down to avoid any muscle discomfort or strain.\n   - Bring your body into a squatting position with your feet hip-width apart for an extra layer of stability and control.",
