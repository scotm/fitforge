Ensure they are parallel to each other and that there is enough space for your body to move between them.\n\n2. **Start Position:** Get into a plank position with your hands gripping the handles of the parallettes. Your arms should be fully extended, and your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.\n   - **Tip:** Stack your shoulders over your wrists, and engage your core to maintain a straight plank.\n\n3. **Lowering Phase:** Bend your elbows to lower your body towards the ground. Your elbows should be at a 45-degree angle to your torso as you descend.\n   - **Tip:** Keep your elbows close to your sides to maximize chest engagement.\n\n4. **Bottom Position:** Lower your body until your chest is in line with the parallettes or your shoulders are just below your elbows.\n   - **Caution:** Do not let your hips sag or pike upwards.\n\n5. **Push Back Up:** Press through your hands and straighten your arms to return to the starting position.\n   - **Tip:** Exhale as you push up and squeeze your chest muscles at the top.\n\n6. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining form throughout each rep.",
