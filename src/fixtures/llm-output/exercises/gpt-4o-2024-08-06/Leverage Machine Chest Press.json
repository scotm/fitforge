  "name": "Leverage Machine Chest Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Initial Setup:** Set the seat height so that your hands are in line with your chest when you extend your arms. Adjust lever arms to the desired starting position, typically where your elbows form a 90-degree angle when the handles are gripped.\n\n2. **Positioning:** Sit down on the machine with your back pressed against the backrest. Feet should be flat on the ground to provide stability throughout the exercise. Grasp the handles with a firm grip, palms facing forward.\n\n3. **Starting Position:** Ensure your back remains in contact with the backrest. Your elbows should be slightly below shoulder height, and the handles should be positioned at the level of mid-chest.\n\n4. **Press Movement:** Inhale slightly (optional) and then exhale as you extend your arms forward to push the handles away from your chest. Keep a controlled motion and avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement.\n\n5. **Return Movement:** Inhale as you slowly return to the starting position by bending your elbows and bringing the handles back towards your chest in a controlled manner. Ensure that the weights do not touch the rest of the stack to maintain tension on the muscles.\n\n6. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions as part of your workout routine.\n\n7. **Completion and Rest:** Once the set is complete, carefully allow the weights to return fully to the stack before releasing the handles and exiting the machine. Rest as needed before continuing with your next set or exercise.",
