  "name": "Bench Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup the Bench**: Position a flat bench in the center of a power rack or bench press station. Ensure the bench is stable and aligned properly under the barbell.\n\n2. **Load the Barbell**: Place the desired weight plates securely onto each end of the barbell. Always use safety collars to prevent the plates from slipping.\n\n3. **Position Yourself**: Lie back on the bench with your eyes directly under the barbell. Your head, shoulders, back, and buttocks should firmly contact the bench, and your feet should be flat on the floor for stability.\n\n4. **Grip the Barbell**: With your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, grasp the barbell with a comfortable and balanced grip. Your palms should be facing forward (overhand grip).\n\n5. **Unrack the Barbell**: Straighten your arms to lift the barbell off the rack. Move the barbell forward and position it directly above your chest.\n\n6. **Lower the Barbell**: Inhale as you slowly lower the barbell to your chest. Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.\n\n7. **Press the Barbell**: Exhale as you push the barbell upward by extending your arms fully. Keep the barbell steady and in control, returning it to the starting position above your chest.\n\n8. **Complete Repetitions**: Repeat the lowering and pressing motion for the number of repetitions desired, maintaining good form.\n\n9. **Rerack the Barbell**: After completing your set, carefully guide the barbell back to the rack, ensuring it is securely placed back onto the hooks.",
