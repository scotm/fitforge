Step forward slightly to create tension on the cables and position your body in a staggered stance for better balance.\n4. Slightly bend your knees and lean forward just a bit, keeping your back straight and core engaged.\n5. Start with your arms open wide, elbows slightly bent but locked in position, this is your starting position.\n6. Exhale as you bring the handles together in front of you in a wide arc, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows throughout the movement.\n7. Squeeze your chest at the peak of the contraction, with your hands approximately at your chest level without the handles touching.\n8. Inhale as you slowly return to the starting position, allowing your arms to move in a controlled arc back until you feel a stretch in your chest.\n9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions while maintaining proper form.",
