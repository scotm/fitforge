  "name": "Face Pull",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Set up a cable pulley machine with a double rope attachment and adjust the pulley to slightly above eye level.\n\n2. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grasp the rope with both hands using a neutral grip (palms facing each other), with your hands about shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. Step back until your arms are fully extended and there is tension on the cable. Your stance should be firm, with knees slightly bent and core engaged.\n\n4. As you begin the movement, pull the rope towards your face, keeping your elbows high and out to the sides. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull.\n\n5. At the end of the movement, your hands should be beside your face, with your elbows flaring outward and your upper arms parallel to the floor.\n\n6. Hold the contraction for a brief moment while maintaining tension in your upper back and rear shoulders.\n\n7. Slowly reverse the movement, extending your arms back to the starting position while maintaining control over the rope.\n\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
