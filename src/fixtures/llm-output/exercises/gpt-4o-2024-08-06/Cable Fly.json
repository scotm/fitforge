  "name": "Cable Fly",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Begin by adjusting the pulleys of a cable machine to chest height. Attach D-handle attachments to each pulley and stand equidistant between the two cable stacks. Grasp each handle with your palms facing forward.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Step forward slightly with one foot for stability and lean your body slightly forward at the waist. Your arms should be extended out to your sides with a slight bend in the elbows. This is your starting position.\n\n3. **Execution**: Maintaining the slight elbow bend, bring your hands together in front of you in a wide arc, feeling a contraction in your chest muscles. Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the movement.\n\n4. **Contraction**: Once your hands meet in front of your chest, pause for a moment to maximize the contraction in your chest.\n\n5. **Return**: Slowly return to the starting position by reversing the arc, keeping the movement controlled and feeling the stretch in your chest muscles.\n\n6. **Breathing**: Exhale as you bring your hands together, and inhale as you return to the starting position.\n\n7. **Repetition**: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
