  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Machine**: Adjust the leg curl machine to fit your height and size. Ensure that the pad rests comfortably on the back of your legs, just above your heels, with your legs fully extended.\n2. **Choose Your Weight**: Set the weight stack to the desired resistance. Beginners should start with a lower weight to focus on form and gradually increase the weight as strength builds.\n3. **Position Your Body**: Lie face down on the leg curl machine. Position your legs under the padded lever with your knees just off the edge of the bench.\n4. **Grip the Handles**: Grasp the handles to stabilize your upper body. This will help maintain a proper form and prevent unnecessary movement.\n5. **Brace Your Core**: Engage your core muscles to stabilize your spine and prevent your body from rising off the bench.\n6. **Curl the Weight**: Exhale and slowly curl your legs by bending your knees, pulling your heels towards your buttocks. Keep your hips down and ensure only your lower legs are moving. Hold the top position for a brief moment to maximize muscle contraction.\n7. **Lower the Weight**: Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position by extending your knees. Control the movement to prevent the weights from slamming down.\n8. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, usually between 8-12 for strength training.\n9. **End the Exercise**: Once completed, carefully release the handles and slide off the machine.",
