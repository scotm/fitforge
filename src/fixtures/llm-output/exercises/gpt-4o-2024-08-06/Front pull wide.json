  "name": "Front Pull Wide",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting up an adjustable cable machine with a wide bar attached to the high pulley.\n\n2. Stand facing the cable machine and adjust the bar to be at chest height.\n\n3. Grasp the bar with both hands, using an overhand grip that is wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n4. Step back slightly so that there is tension on the cable, and stand with a slight bend in the knees, keeping your feet shoulder-width apart.\n\n5. Engage your core and keep your back straight as you pull the bar towards your chest, keeping your elbows flared out to the sides.\n\n6. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as you bring the bar close to your chest.\n\n7. Hold the contraction for a moment, then slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, keeping control of the weight.\n\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring to maintain good form throughout the exercise. Focus on using your back muscles rather than your arms to pull the weight.",
