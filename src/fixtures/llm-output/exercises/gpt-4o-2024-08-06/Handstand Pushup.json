  "name": "Handstand Pushup",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Begin by positioning yourself in a handstand**\n   - Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the floor, ensuring your fingers are spread wide for stability.\n   - Kick up against a wall to help maintain balance if necessary. Alternatively, you can use a partner to assist you in getting into the handstand position.\n\n2. **Engage your core and glutes** to maintain a straight line from head to heels. Keep your body tight and avoid arching your back or flaring your ribs.\n\n3. **Lower your body into the pushup**, focusing on bending your elbows while keeping your head aligned with your spine.\n   - Control the descent by maintaining strong engagement through your shoulders, triceps, and core.\n   - Allow your elbows to move out slightly while lowering your head towards the ground.\n\n4. **Pause briefly once your head is just above the floor**, ensuring that your body remains stable and in control.\n\n5. **Push through your hands to extend your arms** and return to the starting handstand position. Make sure to press all the way up until your elbows are locked out.\n\n6. **Perform the desired number of repetitions**, maintaining proper form and alignment throughout each.\n\n7. **Finish by exiting the handstand carefully**, either by lowering one leg at a time or by somersaulting out if you are experienced enough.",
