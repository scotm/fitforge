  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by securing your feet under a stable object or have a partner hold your ankles firmly. Kneel on a soft surface such as a mat to protect your knees.\n2. Keep your body straight from shoulders to knees, maintaining a neutral spine throughout the movement.\n3. Slowly lower your torso forward by straightening your knees, resisting the fall with your hamstring muscles. Lower as far as you can control.\n4. If you reach the ground, you can catch yourself with your hands in a push-up position.\n5. Use your hamstrings to pull yourself back up to the starting position. Your arms should assist only lightly if necessary.\n6. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring to keep your body aligned and your core engaged throughout.",
