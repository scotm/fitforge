  "name": "Rest",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Find a Comfortable Position**: Choose a position that you find relaxing, such as lying down on a bed, sitting back in a comfortable chair, or even stretching out on a plush carpet. Ensure your body is well-supported and there are no unnecessary strains or pressure points.\n\n2. **Close Your Eyes**: Gently close your eyes to help reduce visual distractions, signalling to your body that it's time to relax.\n\n3. **Breathe Deeply**: Inhale deeply through the nose, feeling your chest and stomach expand. Exhale slowly through the mouth, pushing out all the air and allowing your body to release tension. Maintain a steady rhythm of deep breathing.\n\n4. **Feel the Weight of Your Body**: Allow your muscles to relax and feel the weight of your body being fully supported by the surface beneath you. Take a moment to be aware of how every part of your body feels.\n\n5. **Clear Your Mind**: Focus on something peaceful or practice mindfulness by paying attention to your breathing and the present moment, letting go of any stressful thoughts.\n\n6. **Stay Still**: Remain in this position without moving for a set period, whether it's a few minutes or longer. Listen to your body and adjust as needed to remain comfortable.\n\n7. **Slowly Reawaken**: When you're ready to stop resting, begin to slowly wiggle your fingers and toes. Open your eyes softly, take a final deep breath, and gently sit up or stand.",
