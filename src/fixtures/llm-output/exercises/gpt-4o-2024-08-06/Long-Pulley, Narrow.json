  "name": "Long-Pulley, Narrow",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by sitting on the bench attached to the long-pulley machine and place your feet flat against the footpad or foot rests. Your legs should be slightly bent at the knees.\n2. Lean forward slightly to grasp the pulley handle with both hands using a neutral grip (palms facing each other). The handle should be closer to the pulley at this point.\n3. Sit upright, pulling the handle towards your torso. Keep your back straight and chest forward. This is your starting position.\n4. Begin the movement by pulling the handle straight towards your abdomen, keeping your elbows close to your body.\n5. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull, engaging your back muscles.\n6. Once the handle reaches just above your stomach or around your lower chest, pause for a second and feel the contraction in your back muscles.\n7. Slowly release the handle back to the starting position, extending your arms but keeping a slight bend in the elbows at the end range.\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions while maintaining control throughout the exercise.",
