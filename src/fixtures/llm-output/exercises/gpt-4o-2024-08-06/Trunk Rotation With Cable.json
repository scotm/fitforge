  "name": "Trunk Rotation With Cable",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: \n   - Stand facing the cable machine with one side's cable arm at a comfortable height and about shoulder-width apart from your other side.\n   \n\n\n2. **Starting Position**: \n   - Hold onto the bar with both hands at an equal distance away, grip it firmly with palms facing the direction of the force.\n\n\n3. **Initial Movement**:\n   - Focus on engaging your core, keep it tight as you take a couple of steps back from the machine to ensure even load distribution across your trunk.\n\n\n4. **Rotation**: \n\n     Rotate your trunk by twisting your torso away and then back towards the cable machine's direction.\n\n\n        - Make sure your lower body (legs and feet) doesn't move.\n\n5. **Alternate Movement**:\n\n\n   - As you perform each rotation, try maintaining control throughout, pause briefly for a moment at the end of the movement.\n       Alternate sides on every subsequent repetition to ensure targeted engagement across each half of your core muscle.\n\n\n6. **Repeat**: \n   - Adjust the height and tension level of the cable machine if necessary to find an ideal balance for your strength goals and continue alternating between 8-12 reps or as recommended.",
