  "name": "Incline Push-up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Find a stable, elevated surface. This could be a bench, a low wall, a sturdy table, or a step. Ensure that the surface can support your full body weight and does not move.\n2. Stand in front of the elevated surface and place your hands shoulder-width apart on the edge. Your fingers should point forward and your thumbs should wrap around the edge if possible to ensure a secure grip.\n3. Walk your feet backward until your legs are straight and your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Your arms should be perpendicular to your body, with your shoulders directly above your wrists. Engage your core to prevent your hips from sagging.\n4. Lower your body towards the surface by bending your elbows, keeping them at about a 45-degree angle relative to your body. Maintain a straight line from your head to your heels as you descend, ensuring your core and glutes are engaged.\n5. Lower your chest until it is just above the surface, pausing briefly at the bottom of the movement. Your elbows should not flare out beyond your hands.\n6. Push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position. Exhale as you press up, keeping your body in a straight line throughout the movement.\n7. Perform the desired number of repetitions, ensuring each push-up is controlled and maintains proper form and alignment.",
