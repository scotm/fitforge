  "how_to_perform": "1. **Position Yourself on the Machine:** Sit comfortably on the leg press machine with your back and head flat against the padded support. Ensure your buttocks are positioned firmly on the seat.\n\n2. **Adjust the Foot Position:** Place your feet on the platform with a narrow stance, about shoulder-width apart or a bit closer. Make sure that the toes are pointed slightly outward, but not excessively.\n\n3. **Adjust the Seat and Range of Motion:** Ensure the seat is adjusted so that when your knees are bent, they form approximately a 90-degree angle or slightly less. Adjust the safety stop for your range of motion, if available on the machine.\n\n4. **Release the Safety Bars:** If your machine has safety handles or bars, release them carefully after setting your body correctly in place.\n\n5. **Perform the Press Movement:** Slowly extend your legs and press the platform away from you by straightening your knees, but do not lock them out fully at the top of the movement.\n\n6. **Control the Descent:** Begin to lower the platform by bending your knees, ensuring that you control the movement and do not let the weight drop too quickly.\n\n7. **Keep Proper Form Throughout:** Throughout the exercise, ensure that your feet remain flat on the platform and your back stays flat against the support pad. Avoid lifting your heels.\n\n8. **Repeat as Desired:** Continue the motion, performing the desired number of repetitions.\n\n9. **Replace the Safety Bars:** Once you finish your set, carefully replace the safety bars to secure the weights before stepping off the machine.",
