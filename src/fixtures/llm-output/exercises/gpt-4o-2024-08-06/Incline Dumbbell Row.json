  "name": "Incline Dumbbell Row",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by setting an adjustable bench to an incline of about 30 to 45 degrees. Ensure the bench is stable and secure before beginning the exercise.\n\n2. Choose a pair of dumbbells with an appropriate weight for your fitness level and goals. Position the dumbbells on the ground near the head of the bench.\n\n3. Lie face down on the inclined bench, with your chest against the bench padding and your feet planted firmly on the floor. Your head should be slightly above the top edge of the bench, and your neck in a neutral position.\n\n4. Reach down to pick up the dumbbells from the floor, keeping your arms hanging straight down while maintaining a slight bend in the elbows. Your palms should be facing each other in a neutral grip.\n\n5. Brace your core by slightly engaging your abdominal muscles, and ensure your spine remains aligned.\n\n6. Begin the row by pulling the dumbbells upward towards your ribcage, focusing on using your back muscles. Pinch your shoulder blades together as you draw the weights up, keeping your elbows close to the body.\n\n7. Hold at the top of the movement briefly, ensuring you feel the contraction in your back muscles.\n\n8. Lower the dumbbells slowly back to the starting position, fully extending your arms while maintaining control over the weights.\n\n9. Repeat the motion for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout each repetition.\n\n10. Once you have completed the set, carefully return the dumbbells to the ground by reversing the initial pick-up movement.",
