  "name": "Incline Dumbbell Row",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Bench:** Adjust the bench to an incline of about 30-45 degrees.\n\n2. **Select Your Dumbbells:** Choose a pair of dumbbells with a weight that you can lift for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on maintaining good form.\n\n3. **Position Yourself on the Bench:** Lie face down on the bench, ensuring your chest is supported. Let your arms hang straight down towards the floor while holding the dumbbells with your palms facing inwards (neutral grip).\n\n4. **Stabilize Your Body:** Press your feet into the floor or, if not reaching, the floor supports of the bench, keeping your legs straight. Maintain a neutral spine alignment by keeping your head in line with your spine.\n\n5. **Begin the Row Movement:** Engage your core and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull the dumbbells up towards your ribcage. Keep your elbows close to your body and focus on pulling with your back muscles rather than your arms.\n\n6. **Pause and Contract:** Once youâ€™ve lifted the dumbbells to your torso, pause briefly while squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\n\n7. **Lower the Dumbbells:** Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position, maintaining control to avoid dropping them.\n\n8. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, ensuring each rep is controlled and maintains good form. Adjust weight if necessary for future sets to maintain proper technique.",
