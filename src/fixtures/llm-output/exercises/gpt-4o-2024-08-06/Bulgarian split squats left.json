  "name": "Bulgarian Split Squats - Left",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up:** Stand about two feet in front of a bench or a step. The bench should be about knee-height. Face away from the bench.\n\n2. **Position the Back Foot:** Lift your left foot and place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. Your right foot should be firmly planted on the ground in front of you.\n\n3. **Find Your Balance:** Ensure that your right foot is far enough forward so that when you lower into the squat, your knee does not go past your toes. Adjust as necessary.\n\n4. **Engage Core:** Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your torso. Keep your torso upright.\n\n5. **Lower Your Body:** Begin the movement by bending your right knee and lowering your hips directly down towards the ground. As you lower, your left knee will naturally move towards the ground.\n\n6. **Depth of Squat:** Lower yourself until your right thigh is parallel to the floor, or as low as your flexibility and strength allow, making sure the right knee stays in line with the right ankle.\n\n7. **Push Through the Heel:** Press firmly through the heel of your right foot to straighten your leg and return to the starting position.\n\n8. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining balance and form throughout.\n\n9. **Switch Sides:** After completing the set on the left leg, switch and perform the exercise with the right foot on the bench and the left foot planted firmly on the ground in front.",
