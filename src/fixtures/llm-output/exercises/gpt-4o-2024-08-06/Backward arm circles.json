  "name": "Backward Arm Circles",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring a stable base.\n2. Extend your arms sideways at shoulder height, parallel to the ground.\n3. Begin by moving both arms in a circular motion, rotating backwards.\n4. Keep the circles small and controlled at first, gradually increasing the size of the circles as you become comfortable.\n5. Maintain a steady breathing pattern as you rotate your arms, inhaling as you complete the rotation forward and exhaling while moving back.\n6. Focus on keeping your arms straight without locking your elbows, allowing for fluid motion.\n7. Continue the circles for a set duration or number of repetitions, generally about 30 seconds to 1 minute per set.\n8. Make sure to engage your core to maintain balance and proper posture throughout the exercise.",
