  "name": "Hindu Pushup",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position:** Begin in a downward-facing dog position. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your feet should be about hip-width apart. Your body should form an inverted \"V\" with your hips raised high, and your head aligned with your arms. Keep your legs and arms straight but not locked, with your heels pushing down toward the ground.\n\n2. **Lowering Phase:** Begin to bend your elbows and lower your shoulders towards the ground. As you do this, allow your hips to lower as well, moving your body forward in a swooping motion. Keep your elbows close to your body as you descend.\n\n3. **Transition:** As your chest approaches the ground, continue the forward motion, lifting your head and chest upward. Arch your back and extend your arms. Your hips should be lowered close to, but not touching, the ground.\n\n4. **End Position:** Finish in an upward-facing dog position. Your arms should be straight, shoulders back, and chest forward. Your hips are still down, with your gaze directed upwards or forward. Your legs should be extended straight back without touching the floor with your thighs.\n\n5. **Return to Starting Position:** To complete the repetition, push back into the starting downward-facing dog position. Start by bending your hips and pushing your body backward. Straighten your arms and lift your hips back into the inverted \"V\" position.\n\n6. **Repetition:** Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining a smooth flow through each repetition to work both your muscles and your cardiovascular system.",
