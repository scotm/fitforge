  "name": "Underhand Lat Pull Down",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Equipment Setup**: \n   - Sit at a lat pulldown machine with your knees safely secured under the knee pad.\n   Adjust the height of the machine to fit your body, ensuring your legs are not compressing the pad but still stable.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: \n   - Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the lat bar, palms facing upwards towards your feet.\n   Make sure you're seated comfortably and maintain a straight back throughout the exercise.\n\n3. **The Pull Down Movement**:\n   - Begin by squeezing your lats together, engaging your core for stability. Start pulling the bar down towards you until your elbows reach a 90-degree angle.\n   Be mindful of keeping your torso upright and avoiding swinging or jerking movements with your body.\n\n4. **Return to Starting Position**: \n   - Slowly return the handles back to the starting position while maintaining control throughout the movement.\n   Avoid using momentum or simply letting the weight pull you up, instead focusing on the lat muscles' engagement in each repetition.\n\n5. **Repeat**: \n   - Perform the exercise for the desired number of repetitions while keeping your form proper and controlled throughout.",
