  "how_to_perform": "1. **Lying Dumbbell Row:**\n   - Lie face down on an incline bench with your chest at the top of the bench, allowing your arms to hang straight down.\n   - Hold a dumbbell in each hand, with your palms facing each other.\n   - Engage your core and keep your back straight.\n   - Pull the dumbbells up towards your chest by bending your elbows and squeezing your shoulder blades together.\n   - Pause briefly at the top of the movement, ensuring maximum contraction of the back muscles.\n   - Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position with control.\n   - Perform 8-12 repetitions.\n\n2. **Seated Shrug:**\n   - Immediately after the lying dumbbell row, sit on a bench with a straight back and feet flat on the floor.\n   - Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides, with your arms straight and palms facing your body.\n   - Keep your shoulders relaxed and back straight.\n   - Elevate your shoulders towards your ears, squeezing your trapezius muscles.\n   - Hold the contraction for a second at the top.\n   - Lower the shoulders back to the starting position with control.\n   - Perform 10-15 repetitions.\n\n3. **Rest**:\n   - Rest for 30-60 seconds before repeating the superset.\n\n## Notes:\n- The lying dumbbell row focuses on the back muscles, especially the lats and rhomboids, while the seated shrug targets the trapezius muscles directly.\n- Ensure you are using a weight that allows you to maintain proper form throughout all repetitions.",
