  "name": "Crunches With Legs Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat. Bend your knees and raise your legs so your thighs are perpendicular to the ground and your calves are parallel to the floor, forming a 90-degree angle at your knees.\n2. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows out to the sides. Alternatively, you can cross your arms over your chest if that's more comfortable.\n3. Engage your core by pulling your navel in towards your spine. Avoid pulling on your neck or head; instead, use your abdominal muscles to lift your upper body.\n4. Lift your shoulder blades off the mat and curl your upper body towards your knees, exhaling as you do so. Keep your legs stationary and in the 90-degree angle throughout.\n5. Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, squeezing your abdominal muscles.\n6. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position without letting your shoulder blades fully rest on the mat.\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
