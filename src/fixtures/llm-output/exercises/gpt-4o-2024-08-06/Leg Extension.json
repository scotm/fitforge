  "name": "Leg Extension",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Position yourself on the leg extension machine by sitting on the seat and ensuring your back is straight and well-supported by the backrest. Align your knees with the machineâ€™s axis of rotation, which is usually indicated by a point near the pivot where the machine's arm rotates.\n2. Adjust the seat and backrest if necessary to ensure comfortable positioning. Your knees should be bent at a roughly 90-degree angle.\n3. Place your feet under the padded lever, making sure the pad is positioned just above your ankles.\n4. Set the desired resistance or weight by moving the pin into the appropriate weight stack or by adjusting the weight plates.\n5. Grip the handles on the side of the seat for stability. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale, use your quadriceps to extend your legs completely forward. Make sure to control the movement and avoid using momentum.\n6. Squeeze your quadriceps at the top of the movement and hold for a brief moment while ensuring your legs are fully extended but not hyperextended.\n7. Inhale as you slowly lower the weight back to the starting position, bending your knees back to about 90 degrees without letting the weights touch the stack in between reps to maintain tension.\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping form strict throughout the set.",
