  "name": "Side Plank",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Begin by lying on your side with your feet touching and your body in a straight line from head to heels.\n\n2. **Supporting Hand**:\n   - Place the palm of one hand under your shoulder, maintaining a firm grip, with your elbow directly below your shoulder blade.\n\n3. **Placing Feet**:\n   - Rest your other arm on your hip for balance and place the feet of both legs in front of each other, with the heels aligned. This will help maintain proper posture and stability throughout the exercise.\n\n4. **Initial Engagement**:\n   - Engage your core muscles to establish a plank position. Think about drawing your belly button towards your spine as you activate these muscles. Keep your body straight from head to heel, avoiding any sagging or arching.\n\n5. **Holding the Plank Position**:\n   - Hold this plank position for a specified period of time for one repetition (REP). The longer you hold it, the more challenging and beneficial the exercise becomes, focusing on strength and stability in your core muscles.\n\n6. **Switching Positions**:\n   - To perform another repetition, switch sides by bringing your top hand to rest under your opposite shoulder and bottom hand supporting the side of your lower body. Maintain a straight line from head to heels as you position yourself for the second plank.\n\n7. **Alternating Sides**:\n   - Repeat this process for the desired number of reps on each side, focusing on maintaining proper form, breathing naturally, and using your core muscles effectively.",
