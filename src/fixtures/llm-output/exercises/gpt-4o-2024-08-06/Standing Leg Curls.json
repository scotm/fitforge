  "name": "Standing Leg Curl",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Begin by standing in an upright position. Position yourself next to a sturdy object such as a chair, a wall, or a machine with a stable base to hold onto for support.\n\n2. **Initial Position**: Shift your weight onto the leg you are not exercising. This is your supporting leg. Keep it slightly bent to reduce strain on your knee.\n\n3. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles to stabilize your upper body throughout the movement.\n\n4. **Curl the Leg**: Start by bending your working knee (the leg being exercised), bringing your heel up towards your buttocks. Aim for a 90-degree angle at the knee.\n\n5. **Squeeze the Muscle**: At the top of the movement, squeeze your hamstring by holding the contraction for a moment.\n\n6. **Lowering**: Slowly lower your foot back to the starting position. Ensure the movement is controlled to maintain balance and engage the muscle fully.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Do 10-15 repetitions on one leg before switching to the other. Complete 2-3 sets for each leg.\n\n8. **Breathing**: Inhale as you prepare and exhale during the lifting (curl) phase. Inhale again as you lower your leg back down.\n\n9. **Progression**: For added resistance, you can use ankle weights or perform the exercise on a leg curl machine if available.",
