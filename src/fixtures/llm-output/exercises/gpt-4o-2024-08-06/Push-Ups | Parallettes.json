  "name": "Push-Ups on Parallettes",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Place two parallettes on the floor, shoulder-width apart. They should be parallel to each other and positioned so that your hands can grasp them comfortably.\n   2. **Start Position**: Stand behind the parallettes and kneel down. Grab onto the handles of each parallette with a firm grip, ensuring your palms are facing each other (neutral grip). Extend your legs back so that your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. You should be on the balls of your feet, and your hands should be aligned below your shoulders.\n   3. **Lowering Phase**: Engage your core and keep your body rigid. Slowly bend your elbows, keeping them close to your body, and lower your chest towards the ground. Lower yourself until your chest is just below the handles of the parallettes or as far as your shoulder mobility comfortably allows.\n   4. **Pushing Phase**: Press through the parallettes by extending your elbows and return to the starting position. Be sure to keep a straight body line throughout the movement without letting your hips sag or your back arch.\n   5. **Repetition**: Repeat the lowering and pushing phases for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining good form and control throughout each rep.",
