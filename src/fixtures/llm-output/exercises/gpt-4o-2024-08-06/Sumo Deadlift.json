  "name": "Sumo Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Stance and Positioning**:\n   - Stand over a barbell with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing outward.\n\n2. **Hand Grip**:\n   - Hold the barbell with an overhand grip that is much wider than shoulder-width. Your hands should be positioned outside of your knees.\n\n3. **Lift and Setup**:\n   - Keeping your back straight, lift up on the barbell by hinging at your hips. Keep your body low and parallel to the ground as you do this.\n\n4. **Setup Positioning**:\n   - Once standing up, ensure that you have an erect posture with your shoulders relaxed down. Engage your core muscles for stability and balance throughout the movement.\n\n5. **Final Movement Phase**:\n   - Perform a full range of motion deadlift by keeping tension in your back muscles, engaging your glutes, and pushing through your heels to stand completely upright at the top of the lift, squeezing any remaining tension out of your muscles as you reach the highest point of the movement.\n\n6. **Returning the Barbell to Ground**:\n   - Lower the barbell back down to starting ground position by releasing the tension in your back muscles and core, but maintaining control and proper form throughout all phases of lowering.\n\n7. **Resting and Repeat**:\n   - Between repetitions, pause briefly and take a controlled rest when standing upright with the weight lowered. Maintain engagement in your stabilizing muscle groups, even between each repeat to maintain optimal form.",
