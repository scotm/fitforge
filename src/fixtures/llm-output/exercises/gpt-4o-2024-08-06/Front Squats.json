  "name": "Front Squat",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Start by positioning yourself under a barbell that is set in a rack at chest level. \n2. **Grip the Bar**: Approach the bar, and place it high on the front of your shoulders. Cross your arms and place your hands on top of the barbell, maintaining a fairly loose grip (alternatively, you can use a clean grip, where your fingers are under the bar and elbows are pointed high).\n3. **Lift Off**: Engage your core, stand up straight, and lift the barbell from the rack by extending your hips and knees. Take a couple of steps back into a stable position.\n4. **Foot Position**: Position your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Your toes should point slightly outward.\n5. **Core Engagement**: Take a deep breath, engage your core, and keep your elbows up to maintain the barâ€™s position on your shoulders.\n6. **Begin Descent**: Initiate the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees. Keep your chest up and your head looking forward.\n7. **Depth**: Lower your body until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor, or go deeper if flexible and comfortable.\n8. **Rise Up**: Drive through your heels to extend your hips and knees, returning to the starting position. Keep your back straight and elbows up throughout the motion.\n9. **Breathing**: Exhale as you ascend and return to the starting position.\n10. **Repetition**: Repeat for the desired number of reps, maintaining form and control throughout each squat.\n11. **Finish**: After your set, carefully step forward and place the barbell back into the rack, making sure it's securely in place before releasing your grip.",
