  "name": "Elevated Prayer Stretch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by kneeling on a comfortable mat or padded surface. Position yourself in front of a stable, elevated surface, such as a bench or a chair. \n\n2. Place your hips directly over your knees, ensuring your legs and feet are in a comfortable kneeling position.\n\n3. Reach forward and place your forearms on the elevated surface. Make sure your elbows are bent at roughly 90 degrees and are slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n4. Bring your hands together as if in prayer position, with your palms touching and fingers pointing straight ahead or up.\n\n5. Slowly lower your head and chest down toward the floor by bending at the waist and relaxing into the stretch. You should feel a gentle stretch in your shoulders, upper back, and chest.\n\n6. Hold this position, breathing deeply, for 20-30 seconds or longer if comfortable. Focus on relaxing your muscles with each exhale to deepen the stretch.\n\n7. To release, gently push yourself back up to the starting position, taking care to do so slowly to avoid strain.\n\n8. Repeat the stretch 2-3 times, ensuring you do it in a controlled and gentle manner to avoid any discomfort.",
