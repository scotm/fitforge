  "name": "Decline Dumbbell Bench Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting the decline bench to a comfortable angle, typically around 15 to 30 degrees. Secure your feet at the end of the bench if applicable, ensuring they are stable and anchored.\n\n2. Sit on the decline bench with a dumbbell in each hand, resting on your thighs. Use a safe amount of weight that allows for full control during the exercise.\n\n3. Carefully lay back on the decline bench while bringing the dumbbells up to your shoulders. Your palms should be facing forward.\n\n4. Position the dumbbells on either side of your chest with your elbows bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Your arms should be wide enough that you feel a slight stretch in your chest.\n\n5. Brace your core and ensure your back is flat against the bench. Your head, shoulders, and glutes should all be in contact with the bench.\n\n6. Press the dumbbells upward by straightening your arms until your elbows are just short of locking out. The weights should come together over your chest, but not touch.\n\n7. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position in a controlled manner, keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body to reduce shoulder stress. Ensure you feel a gentle stretch in your chest muscles.\n\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining a steady and controlled pace throughout the exercise.",
