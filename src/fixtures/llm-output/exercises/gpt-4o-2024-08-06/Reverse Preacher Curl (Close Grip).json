  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by adjusting the seat of the preacher curl bench so that your upper arms sit comfortably on the padding.\n2. With a close grip, grab a barbell from the weight rack. Your hands should be placed shoulder-width apart or slightly narrower, palms facing downward (pronated grip).\n3. Sit down and lean against the preacher bench so that your upper arms are positioned against the pad. Your chest should be firmly pressed into the bench.\n4. Start with your arms fully extended downward and the barbell just above your shins, maintaining a slight bend in your elbows.\n5. Without moving your upper arms, curl the bar upwards by contracting your biceps and forearms, squeezing at the top of the contraction.\n6. Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position, keeping the motion controlled and the tension on your muscles.\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring to maintain good form throughout and avoiding swinging or using momentum.",
