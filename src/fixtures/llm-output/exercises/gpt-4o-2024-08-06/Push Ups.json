  "name": "Push Ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by getting into a high plank position with your arms straight, hands placed shoulder-width apart directly under your shoulders, and your legs extended. Your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.  \n   2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, and keep your back flat.  \n   3. Look slightly ahead of you rather than directly down to keep your neck in a neutral position.  \n   4. Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows, lowering your chest towards the floor. Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your body.  \n   5. Continue lowering until your chest is just above the floor, or as low as your shoulder joint mobility allows without discomfort.  \n   6. Exhale as you push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position, maintaining a straight back and engaged core throughout.  \n   7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout each repetition.",
