  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Incline Bench**: Adjust the incline bench to a moderate incline. Secure it to ensure it won't move during the exercise.\n\n2. **Position Yourself**: Lie back on the bench with your head at the higher end. Place your feet under the footpads to keep your body from sliding down. Your legs should be bent at the knees.\n\n3. **Hand Placement**: Cross your arms over your chest or place your fingertips gently behind your ears. Avoid pulling on your neck with your hands.\n\n4. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles by imagining your navel being pulled towards your spine.\n\n5. **Perform the Crunch**: Exhale and lift your upper body (shoulder blades off the bench) towards your knees. Focus on using your abdominal muscles rather than your neck or arms.\n\n6. **Controlled Descent**: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back to the starting position, maintaining tension in your core. Avoid letting your head rest entirely on the bench between reps.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of reps, maintaining controlled and steady movements throughout.",
