Ensure your fingers are pointing forward.\n3. **Walk your feet back**: Step your feet back until your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Your arms should be perpendicular to the elevated surface.\n4. **Engage your core**: Tighten your core muscles by pulling your belly button in toward your spine to maintain a neutral spine position.\n5. **Bend your elbows**: Slowly lower your chest toward the elevated surface by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows at a 45-degree angle from your body, not flared out wide.\n6. **Lower your body**: Continue to lower your body in a controlled manner until your chest is close to the edge of the surface, or you feel a gentle stretch in your chest muscles.\n7. **Push back up**: Press through your hands to straighten your arms and return to the starting position, keeping your body in a straight line throughout the movement.\n8. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining good form with each push-up.",
