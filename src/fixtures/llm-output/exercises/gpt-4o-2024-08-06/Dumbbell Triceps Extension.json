Grasp a dumbbell with both hands, ensuring that your palms are facing upward, and the dumbbell rests between your thumbs and index fingers. Your hands should be cupping one end of the dumbbell.\n\n3. Lift the dumbbell overhead by extending your arms fully. Your elbows should be close to your head, and your upper arms should be stationary and upright.\n\n4. Keeping your upper arms still, slowly lower the dumbbell behind your head by bending your elbows. Make sure your elbows are pointing forward throughout the movement and not flaring out to the sides.\n\n5. Inhale as you lower the dumbbell until you feel a stretch in your triceps and your forearms touch your biceps.\n\n6. Exhale as you extend your arms back to the starting position, focusing on contracting the triceps as you lift the dumbbell overhead.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions while maintaining good form and control.",
