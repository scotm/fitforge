  "name": "Face Pull",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Attach a rope handle to a cable station at upper chest height. Stand facing the cable machine with your feet shoulder-width apart. Set the weight to a manageable load.\n\n2. **Grip:** Hold the ends of the rope with an overhand grip (palms facing down). Stand back away from the machine until your arms are fully extended in front of you, and there is tension in the cable.\n\n3. **Position:** Stand upright with a slight bend in your knees for stability. Engage your core to keep the body steady throughout the movement.\n\n4. **Execution:** Start pulling the rope towards your face while flaring your elbows outwards. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull back.\n\n5. **Breathing:** Inhale at the starting position and exhale as you pull the rope toward your face.\n\n6. **Control:** Keep the movement slow and controlled. Pause briefly when the rope is close to your face.\n\n7. **Return:** Extend your arms slowly back to the starting position, maintaining tension in the cable. Avoid letting the weight stack touch down completely between repetitions.\n\n8. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions to complete your set.\n\n9. **Tip:** Keep your wrists straight during the movement and avoid arching your back.",
