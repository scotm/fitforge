  "name": "Negative Crunches",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by lying down on your back on a mat or the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Place your feet about hip-width apart.\n\n2. Cross your arms over your chest or place your fingertips lightly behind your head, ensuring you're not pulling on your neck.\n\n3. Engage your core by pulling your navel in toward your spine and flattening your lower back against the mat.\n\n4. Lift your shoulder blades off the mat by engaging your abdominal muscles, keeping your chin slightly tucked towards your chest to avoid neck strain. This is the starting position.\n\n5. Slowly lower your upper body back toward the mat in a controlled manner, focusing on engaging your abs to resist the force of gravity. This is where the 'negative' aspect of the exercise comes into play.\n\n6. Lower your body as close to the mat as possible without actually resting your shoulders or head, maintaining tension in your core throughout.\n\n7. Once you've reached the bottom of the movement, immediately begin the next repetition by lifting your shoulder blades back up to the starting position, using your core muscles. \n\n8. Perform the desired number of repetitions, focusing on slow and controlled movements both upwards and downwards.",
