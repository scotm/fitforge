  "how_to_perform": "## Zone 2 Running Instructions\n### Step 1: Determine Your Intensity Zone\n**Find Your Zone**: Before starting your run, understand what pace you will maintain during the exercise. This is typically considered easy running or a casual jog.\n### Step 2: Warm Up (Optional)\n**Choose to Warm Up**: Depending on the start of your workout routine, choose whether you want to include a warm-up session prior to Zone 2 Running. Keep this movement light and short as we will build intensity during our run.\n### Step 3: Begin the Run\n1. Place one foot flat on the ground, keeping the other foot lifted off the ground (whichever is more comfortable for you).\n2. Start with a steady pace in your designated zone. Remember that this should feel easy or casual to help you stay within Zone 2.\n\n### Step 4: Focus and Endure\nAs we run, maintain a consistent pace (one speed). Stay focused on how you are breathing and where your body is at.\n\n3. Maintain the intensity for your designated distance or time.\n\n### Step 5: Cool Down\nOnce you have completed the prescribed session, incorporate some gentle stretching movements to aid in recovery.\n\n**Tips and Tips for Mastery**: As you become more comfortable with this exercise, remember that zone running works different muscle groups on varying days, so experiment to see what feels most effective for you. If possible, try recording your sessions and looking over them afterwards to compare progress.",
