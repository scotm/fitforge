  "name": "Leg Raises on Pull-Up Bar",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by standing beneath a pull-up bar and reaching up to grasp the bar with a pronated (overhand) grip. Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart.\n2. Allow your body to hang freely from the bar, keeping your arms fully extended and your legs straight.\n3. Tighten your abdominal muscles by pulling your navel towards your spine to engage your core.\n4. Begin the movement by raising your legs away from the ground, keeping them as straight as possible. The goal is to bring your legs up to approximately a 90-degree angle with your torso, making your body form an \"L\" shape.\n5. Ensure that your movements are slow and controlled, keeping your core engaged.\n6. Pause briefly at the top of the movement, when your legs reach parallel to the floor.\n7. Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.\n8. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
