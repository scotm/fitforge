  "name": "Incline Bench Reverse Fly",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:**\n   - Place an adjustable bench at a 30 to 45-degree incline.\n   - Select a pair of dumbbells of appropriate weight. Start with lighter weights to ensure proper form.\n   \n2. **Positioning:**\n   - Sit on the bench in a reverse position: your chest should be against the padded seat, with your feet firmly on the ground to stabilize your body.\n   - Lean forward so your chest is supported by the bench, which allows your arms to hang straight down with a dumbbell in each hand. Your palms should be facing each other.\n   \n3. **Execution:**\n   - Begin the movement by retracting your shoulder blades (squeeze them together) to initiate a slight lift of the weights. This primes the correct muscles for the exercise.\n   - With a controlled motion, raise the dumbbells out to your sides in a wide arc. Keep your elbows slightly bent.\n   - Lift the weights until your arms are nearly parallel to the floor, but avoid jerking or swinging them.\n   \n4. **Peak Contraction:**\n   - At the top of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together while keeping your core engaged to stabilize the movement.\n   - Hold this position for a brief second to maximize muscle engagement.\n   \n5. **Lowering Phase:**\n   - Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position with controlled movement, ensuring you don't drop them quickly.\n   - Maintain tension in your shoulder blade muscles throughout the descent to avoid any unnecessary strain or momentum.\n   \n6. **Completion:**\n   - Perform the recommended number of repetitions, typically 8-12, according to your workout plan.\n   \n7. **Tips:**\n   - Keep your head in a neutral position and ensure you're breathing steadily throughout the exercise.\n   - Focus on maintaining a slight bend in your elbows to protect your joints while performing the movement.",
