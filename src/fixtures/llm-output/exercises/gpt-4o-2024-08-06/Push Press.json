  "name": "Push Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place a barbell across your upper chest, gripping the bar slightly wider than shoulder-width with your palms facing forward.\n\n2. Engage your core and maintain an upright torso.\n\n3. Bend your knees slightly, similar to a quarter squat or dip, keeping your chest up and back straight. This is your dip position.\n\n4. From this position, explosively extend your knees and hips, using the power generated from your lower body to help drive the barbell overhead.\n\n5. As the barbell rises above your head, continue to extend your arms completely, ending with the barbell directly above your head. Your elbows should be locked out and the bar directly in line with your shoulders, hips, and ankles.\n\n6. Hold this position for a moment to stabilize the bar.\n\n7. Carefully lower the bar back to the starting position across your chest while maintaining control.\n\n8. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
