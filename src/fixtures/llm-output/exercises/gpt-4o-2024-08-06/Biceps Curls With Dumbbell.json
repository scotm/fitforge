Ensure that your elbows are close to your torso, and keep your palms facing forward. This will be your starting position.\n3. Keeping the upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights while contracting your biceps. Continue to raise the weights until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level.\n4. Hold the contracted position for a brief pause as you squeeze your biceps.\n5. Inhale and slowly begin to lower the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n6. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",
