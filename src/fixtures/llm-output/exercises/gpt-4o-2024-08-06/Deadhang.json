  "name": "Deadhang",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Find a pull-up bar**: Locate a sturdy pull-up bar that is capable of supporting your body weight.\n2. **Grip the bar**: Reach up and grab the bar with both hands, palms facing forward (overhand grip) and shoulder-width apart. Optionally, you can use an underhand grip (palms facing you) or a mixed grip (one palm facing you, one palm facing away) if preferred.\n3. **Engage your grip**: Make sure you are holding the bar firmly but comfortably, without hyperextending your wrists.\n4. **Lift your feet**: Gently lift your feet off the ground so that you are freely hanging from the bar with your arms fully extended.\n5. **Hang passively**: Allow your body to hang naturally without engaging your shoulders or lats excessively. This is a passive hang, so relax your shoulders, letting them rise up slightly as you hang.\n6. **Maintain position**: Keep your core engaged to prevent excessive swinging or arching in your back. Your body should be in a straight line with your feet together.\n7. **Breathe and hold**: Breathe naturally and hold this position for as long as you maintain a good form, or for the desired time frame (typically 20-60 seconds for beginners).\n8. **Dismount safely**: When you are finished, carefully lower your feet back to the ground while maintaining control.\n\n**Note**: If you have difficulty maintaining a grip, consider using chalk or grips to improve your hold on the bar.",
