  "name": "Braced Squat",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart**. Your toes should be pointing slightly outward. This will help balance and stability during the squat.\n\n2. **Grasp a weight plate or a dumbbell with both hands**, holding it close to your chest. This is your brace. Ensure the weight is manageable to maintain proper form and prevent injury. \n\n3. **Engage your core muscles** by tightening your abs as though you're preparing to take a punch. This helps stabilize your spine.\n\n4. **Begin the squat by bending your knees and hips**, pushing your hips back as if you're going to sit on a chair. Keep your back straight and chest up, ensuring that your knees do not go past your toes.\n\n5. **Lower yourself until your thighs are parallel to the floor** or as far as your flexibility comfortably allows. Make sure your weight remains distributed evenly across your feet, more on your heels than your toes.\n\n6. **Pause for a moment at the bottom of the squat**. This helps emphasize control and balance.\n\n7. **Drive through your heels to return to a standing position**. As you push up, focus on squeezing your glutes and maintaining a tight core.\n\n8. **Repeat for the desired number of repetitions** ensuring each squat is performed with controlled form for maximum effectiveness.",
