  "name": "Inverted Rows",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up:**\n   - Find a Smith machine or a squat rack that has a barbell. Set the barbell to about waist height.\n   - Alternatively, you can use a suspension trainer or rings, adjusting them so your torso is parallel to the ground when you hold the handles.\n\n2. **Position Yourself:**\n   - Lie on your back under the barbell or anchor point.\n   - Reach up and grab the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you), slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. If using rings, grip each handle firmly.\n   - Your feet should be flat on the floor with your legs extended, your body in a straight line from head to heels.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core:**\n   - Tighten your core muscles, keeping your body rigid and in a straight line.\n   - Pull your shoulder blades down and back before you start the movement.\n\n4. **Pull Yourself Up:**\n   - Keeping your body straight, pull your chest up towards the bar by driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together.\n   - Your chest should touch or come close to the bar at the top of the movement.\n\n5. **Lower Yourself:**\n   - Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with controlled motion, fully extending your arms while maintaining a straight body.\n\n6. **Repeat:**\n   - Aim for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout. If using a suspension trainer, ensure your straps remain taut, and your body stays aligned.",
