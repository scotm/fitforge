  "name": "Inverted Rows",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Bar**: Set a barbell in a squat rack or Smith machine at about waist height. Alternatively, use a sturdy, horizontal, waist-high bar.\n   \n2. **Position Yourself**: Lie on your back underneath the bar. Reach up and grab it with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n   \n3. **Align Your Body**: Your body should form a straight line from head to heels. Keep your feet together and bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor, or keep your legs straight with your heels resting on the ground.\n   \n4. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core and squeeze your glutes; your shoulders should be pulled down and back to avoid rounding them.\n   \n5. **Pull Yourself Up**: Begin the motion by pulling your chest up towards the bar. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\n   \n6. **Pause Briefly**: Hold at the top for a moment where your chest is close to the bar.\n   \n7. **Lower Your Body**: Slowly extend your arms to lower yourself back to the starting position. Maintain control throughout and keep your body straight.\n   \n8. **Repeat**: Aim for 8-12 repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout the exercise.",
