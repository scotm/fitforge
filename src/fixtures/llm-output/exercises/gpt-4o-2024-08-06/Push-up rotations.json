  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in a standard push-up position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your feet hip-width apart.\n2. Keeping your body straight from head to heels, lower your chest to the ground by bending your elbows.\n3. Once your chest is close to the ground, push through your palms to extend your arms back to the push-up position.\n4. As you reach the top of the push-up, shift your weight onto one hand and rotate your torso to bring your other hand toward the ceiling, forming a T shape with your body.\n5. Hold the rotational position for a moment, ensuring your body is straight and aligned.\n6. Slowly return your hand to the floor to get back into the starting push-up position.\n7. Repeat the push-up and then perform the rotation to the opposite side.\n8. Continue alternating sides with each push-up, maintaining control and balance throughout the movement.",
