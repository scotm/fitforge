  "name": "Wall Pushup",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. **Find a Wall**: Choose any wall in your home or gym and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n   - Your hands should be about 1-2 inches away from the wall. Shoulder positioning is key to proper push-up form, so make sure your shoulders are over your toes.\n\n2. **Initial Positioning**:\n   - Place your hands on the wall with your fingers spread and your elbow at a 90-degree angle.\n\n3. **Move into Starting Position**: Make sure your arms fully extend across your body towards the hand position on the wall.\n   Always keep your core tight during push-ups because that helps engage your entire upper body, including the pectorals. Keep your head facing straight ahead and always breathe with an inspired breath in throughout each set.\n\n4. **Start Lowering**: Breathe out as you slowly lower yourself toward the wall by bending your elbows. Don't lean forward on your toes but keep your upper body slightly above the ground for correct posture.\n   \n5. **Push Your Body Away from The Wall**: Then using your pectorals compress your hands against the wall. This motion straightens the arm so your chest muscles can push away. Ensure that you donâ€™t lower yourself far enough to place stress on the joint.\n\n6. **Repeat**:\n   Perform this movement in a cycle between lowering yourself toward and pushing back away from the wall.",
