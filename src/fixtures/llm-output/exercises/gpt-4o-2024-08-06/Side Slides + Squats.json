  "how_to_perform": "# Side Slides + Squats\\n1. **Warm Up**: Before starting, warm up with jogging or light cardio to prepare your muscles.\n\n2. **Equipment Setup**:\n   - Stand next to a flat surface for support and stability.\n\n3. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n   - Hold onto the edge of the surface beside you for balance.\n   - Look forward, keeping your head in a neutral position.\n\n4. **Initial Movement**:\n   - From this stance, step out to one side (either left or right) and slide your foot along the ground while keeping your back straight and core engaged.\n\n5. **Lowering Phase**:\n   - Slowly lower yourself down into a squat by bending at both knees and hips.\n   - Ensure the displacement of weight is even, not biased towards either leg, to maximize impact on gluteus maximus and quadriceps.\n\n6. **Returning to Center**: As you push back up to the top position from your low point in the squat, slide back over to standing with both feet shoulder-width apart.\n   - In this process, each time you move your left or right foot to the side or towards you, execute a full-range-of-motion squat.\n\n7. **Alternative Option**:\n   - To add an additional challenge and focus on balance more intensely, perform balance squats in place where, without sliding your feet sideways, you must keep one leg extended beside the other for stability while lowering down into the squat on alternating legs.",
