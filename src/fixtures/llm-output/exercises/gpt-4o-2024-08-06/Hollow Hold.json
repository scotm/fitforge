  "name": "Hollow Hold",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Lie flat on your back on the floor with your legs extended straight and arms reaching above your head, keeping both your legs and arms in contact with the ground.\n\n2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles by imagining you're pulling your belly button down towards the floor.\n\n3. **Lift**: Slowly raise your legs and upper body off the ground. Keep your lower back flat on the floor. Your body should form a \"hollow\" or a \"C\" shape, with only your lower back touching the floor.\n\n4. **Maintain Position**: Hold this position by maintaining tension in your core, with your arms reaching overhead (but not touching the floor) and legs in line with your body, or slightly lowered for increased difficulty.\n\n5. **Breathing**: Continue to breathe deeply and hold this position for the desired amount of time without letting your lower back rise off the floor or your shoulders sink.\n\n6. **Return to Start**: Slowly lower your arms and legs back to the floor and relax, ensuring a controlled movement to prevent any jerking or sudden drops.",
