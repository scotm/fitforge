  "name": "Hollow Hold",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying flat on your back on the floor or a mat. Extend your arms straight above your head and stretch your body, keeping it long.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine and pressing your lower back into the floor. This ensures that your back does not arch during the exercise.\n\n3. Raise your legs off the ground to about a 30-degree angle, keeping them straight and together. Your heels should be hovering a few inches off the floor.\n\n4. Simultaneously, lift your arms, shoulders, and head off the ground at the same angle, creating a banana shape with your body.\n\n5. Hold this position, making sure to keep your lower back pressed firmly against the floor the entire time.\n\n6. Maintain steady breathing as you hold the position for the desired length of time.\n\n7. To finish, slowly lower your legs and upper body back to the ground, coming back to the starting position.",
