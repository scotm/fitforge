  "name": "Speed Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: \n   - Choose a barbell with weight appropriate for your fitness level.\n   - Stand inside the barbell with feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed straight ahead or slightly outward.\n\n2. **Initial Grip and Posture**: \n   - Hold the barbell with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.\n   - Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine position, with knees slightly bent.\n\n3. **Ascending Path**:\n   - Keeping your back flat and your posture strong, lift the barbell off the ground by straightening your back and extending your hips.\n   - Keep your body close to the bar as you ascend.\n\n4. **Quick Deadlift**: \n   - As you reach the highest point of the deadlift (with the weight at hip level or slightly above), perform a quick repetition in both directions, aiming for light to moderate loads that allow fast, powerful movements.\n   - In the up phase: rapidly lift the barbell off your hips with as much force and speed as possible. This should be done with proper form and technique always maintained.\n\n5. **Down Phase**:\n   - Once you've reached the high point, reverse direction immediately. The movement back down to the starting position should also mimic a fast and powerful downward phase.\n    Ensure your movements remain controlled throughout each repetition, maintaining balance and keeping posture stable at all times.\n\n6. **Repeat**: \n   - Repeat this process for the recommended number of repetitions or sets, focusing on speed while maintaining proper form.",
