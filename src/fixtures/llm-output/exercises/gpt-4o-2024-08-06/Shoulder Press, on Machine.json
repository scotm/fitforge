  "how_to_perform": "1. **Machine Setup**: \n   - Choose a shoulder press machine with adjustable armrests.\n   - Adjust the height of the armrests to fit your body contour.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: \n   - Sit in the machine and settle into it firmly, with your back supporting you against the pad.\n   - Ensure that your feet are flat on the floor or on a foot support if provided by the machine.\n   - Engage your core for stability.\n\n3. **Machine Initiation**:\n   - Familiarize yourself with the control mechanism of the press in front of you.\n   - It is usually operated from behind, facing away from the weight stack or a digital display that shows the weight being lifted.\n   - Make sure the pin is securely set to your chosen exercise load.\n\n4. **Pressing Motion**:\n   - Press against the machine with both hands on the top handles provided for you.\n   - Keep your back straight and your core engaged as you start pressing the weight upwards.\n   - Your arms, now extended above your head, work in conjunction with your shoulders to efficiently generate power.\n\n5. **Returning to Starting Position**:\n   - Once you have completed the desired number of repetitions or reached a specific point that concludes your workout, slowly return the weight back down to its original position by reversing the pressing motion used previously.\n   - Allow the machine's built-in stopping mechanism to guide and secure the weights into place when returning them fully for safety.\n\n6. **Repeat**:\n   - Continue this process based on your chosen set and repetition limits.\n   - Take breaks at regular intervals, always paying close attention to proper procedure and form maintenance throughout all phases of exercise performance.",
