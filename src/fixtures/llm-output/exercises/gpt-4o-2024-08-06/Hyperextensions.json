  "name": "Hyperextensions",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Position yourself on a hyperextension bench, also known as a Roman chair. Adjust the bench so that your hip pads are just below your waistline and allow for a comfortable bend at the hips. Ensure your feet are firmly placed under the foot pads to prevent slipping.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Begin by positioning your body on the pad face down. Cross your arms over your chest, or if you're more advanced, place your hands behind your head. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels.\n\n3. **Execution**: Initiate the movement by bending at your hips to lower your upper body towards the floor. Keep your back straight throughout this motion. Go down until you feel your hamstrings stretch, ensuring you do not go beyond the point of comfort or safety.\n\n4. **Upward Movement**: Reverse the motion by contracting your lower back muscles, and raise your upper body back to the starting position. Avoid swinging or using momentum to lift.\n\n5. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower your body and exhale as you raise it back up.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions with controlled motion for each rep.",
