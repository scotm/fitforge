  "name": "Hyperextensions",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Set up the hyperextension bench so that your thighs rest comfortably on the pads, and your ankles are secured under the foot pads. Adjust the equipment so that your upper thighs are supported while allowing for freedom of motion for your torso.\\n\\n2. Begin by lying face down on the bench with your body forming a straight line from your head to your heels.\\n\\n3. Cross your arms over your chest or place your hands behind your head, but make sure not to pull on your neck.\\n\\n4. Inhale deeply. Bend at the waist and slowly lower your upper body towards the floor. Maintain a slight bend in the knees as you do this to keep tension off the hamstrings. Lower down until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings or until your torso is roughly perpendicular to the floor.\\n\\n5. Hold the bottom position for a moment ensuring that youâ€™re engaging the core and back muscles.\\n\\n6. Exhale as you slowly raise your upper body back to the starting position, ensuring to keep a straight back throughout the movement. Focus on squeezing the lower back muscles as you lift.\\n\\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, usually 8-15 per set depending on your fitness level and the additional weight, if any, that you may use.\\n\\n8. Once finished, carefully dismount the hyperextension bench.",
