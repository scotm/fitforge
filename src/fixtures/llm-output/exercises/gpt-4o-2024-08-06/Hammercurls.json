  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a pair of dumbbells at your sides. Your palms should face your hips, and the weights should be parallel to each other.\n\n2. Keep your elbows close to your torso and maintain a slight bend in your knees for stability.\n\n3. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body and prevent swaying.\n\n4. Start the curl by flexing your elbows and raising the dumbbells towards your shoulders, making sure to keep your palms facing each other throughout the movement. Your forearm should remain perpendicular to the floor.\n\n5. Keep your upper arms stationary; only your forearms should be moving.\n\n6. Continue lifting until the dumbbells are at shoulder height and your biceps are fully contracted.\n\n7. Pause briefly at the top of the movement, squeezing your biceps.\n\n8. Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position, maintaining control and resisting gravity.\n\n9. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
