  "name": "Single Leg Extension",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand on the edge of a step, bench, or platform with your chosen leg lifted off the ground. Hold onto something stable for balance if needed.\n   - Ensure you have sufficient height to lift the opposite leg clear of the floor.\n\n2. **Leg Lift**:\n   - Slowly lift the leg that is not in contact with the step off the floor. Keep this raised leg straight, pointing upwards from your hip area.\n\n3. **Extension Movement**:\n   - Continue extending and lifting the raised leg higher without bending or twisting it. Engage your core for stability throughout.\n\n4. **Controlled Lowering**:\n   - Slowly lower the extended leg back to its starting position without touching the floor with the toes, still keeping a straight alignment through the knee.\n\n5. **Breathing**:\n   - Inhale during the process of lifting and exhaling when lowering. This steady rhythm will help maintain control and keep you moving in sync.\n\n6. **Full Range**:\n   - Remember to practice controlled movements across the full range of extension and contraction, maintaining leg straightness throughout.\n   Keep both your mind and body focused on the exercise at hand.",
