Your arm should be fully extended, with the kettlebell at shoulder height.\n\\n\n## Step 2: Curl Motion\n Slowly curl the kettlebell towards your shoulder, keeping your upper arms still. Focus on using only your bicep to lift the weight, and avoid swinging or jerking movements.\n\\n\n## Step 3: Lowering Phase\n Lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position, taking care not to let it swing or bounce.\n\\n\n## Step 4: Alternate Arms\n Alternate arms with each repetition, ensuring you work both biceps equally throughout the exercise.\n\\n\n## Important Form Tips:\n Keep your core engaged and your arm close to your body during the curl motion. Avoid letting the kettlebell swing or using momentum to lift it. Focus on controlled movements and proper form to target the correct muscles.",
