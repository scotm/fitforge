  "name": "Dynamic Side Hold",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position:** Begin by lying on your side with your legs extended. Stack your feet on top of each other. Place your lower arm on the ground for support, and your upper hand can either rest on your hip or be raised above your head for an additional challenge.\n\n2. **Lift Hips:** Engage your core and lift your hips off the ground so that your body forms a straight line from head to feet. Your support should come from your forearm and the side of your foot.\n\n3. **Create Movement:** Slowly lower your hips down towards the ground, but do not let them touch. Then lift them back to the straight alignment position. This creates a dynamic movement pattern rather than a static hold.\n\n4. **Engage Core Muscles:** Throughout the exercise, keep your core muscles engaged to maintain balance and proper form, preventing the torso from rotating forward or backward.\n\n5. **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower your hips and exhale as you lift them back up. Maintain a steady and controlled breathing pattern.\n\n6. **Repetition:** Perform the desired number of repetitions on one side, then switch to the other side and repeat.\n\n7. **Cooldown:** After finishing both sides, take a moment to stretch and release any tension.",
