  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward or slightly outward.\n\n2. **Descending Phase**:\n Slowly lower your body by bending your knees and hips, keeping your back straight and your weight evenly distributed between both legs.\n Lower yourself until your upper arms are at a 90-degree angle to the ground, or as low as you comfortably can.\n Keep your core engaged to maintain stability throughout the movement.\n\n3. **Transition Phase**:\n From this position, explosively push yourself back up to standing, using the strength in your legs and hips to propel yourself upward.\n As you thrust upwards, quickly switch from a squatting position back to standing with both feet on the ground again, using your momentum to gain height.\n\n4. Repeat**: \n Perform the movement for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on maintaining proper form and control throughout each repetition.",
