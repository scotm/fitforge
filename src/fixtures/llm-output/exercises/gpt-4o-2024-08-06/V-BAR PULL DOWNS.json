  "name": "V-Bar Pull Downs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Hold onto a v-bar attachment with your hands shoulder-width apart, palms facing you (towards the bar).\n\n2. Grasp the bar firmly with each hand, positioning your arms so that they are bent slightly at an angle with respect to your chest.\n\n3. Ensure proper posture: Engage your core muscles and pull the shoulders down away from their original position, thus lowering and straightening your lower back as much as possible. Your eyes should remain focused upwards towards the ceiling throughout this exercise.\n\n4. Maintaining engagement of the core and ensuring that all shoulders stay down away from their peak positions (pulling your body forward), carefully pull-down on the v-bar, bending at both elbows with each arm contributing to this movement in an equal manner, until you can feel a stretch beneath your chest muscles (pectoral region).\n\n5. **Hold and Release**: Briefly pause for a moment when the angle formed between arms is reduced as much as possible without moving further downwards into stretching the muscles excessively - aim for an elbow angle slightly below 90 degrees.\n\n6. Then, return to starting position by pressing back up on the v bar with your hands while keeping core support stable, maintain form throughout full extension, ensuring both elbows are still close in order to achieve maximum effectiveness of each arm movement.",
