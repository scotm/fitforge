This will be used to elevate your feet.\n\n2. **Position Your Feet:** Place your feet on the elevated surface. The higher your feet are, the more challenging the exercise will be.\n\n3. **Assume the Starting Position:** Walk your hands out in front of you until your body is in the plank position. Your hands should be placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart and your body should form a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core, keeping your back flat and hips level.\n\n4. **Perform the Push-Up:** Bend your elbows and lower your body towards the ground. Your elbows should be at about a 45-degree angle to your body, not flaring out too wide.\n\n5. **Go Down as Low as Comfortable:** Lower yourself until your chest is just above the ground or go as low as is comfortable while maintaining good form.\n\n6. **Push Up to Starting Position:** Push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting plank position.\n\n7. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining a steady pace and good form throughout the exercise.",
