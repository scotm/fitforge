Keep your back straight and chest up.  \n2. **Step Forward:** Take a step forward with your right leg, keeping your left foot in its initial position. Ensure that your step is big enough so that when you lunge down, your knee does not go past your foot.  \n3. **Lower Yourself:** Bend your knees and lower your hips until both knees are bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. Your right thigh should be parallel to the floor, and your left knee should be just above the ground. Avoid letting your front knee extend beyond your toes.\n4. **Maintain Balance:** Ensure your torso stays upright throughout the movement and your back is not slouched. Keep the dumbbells steady in each hand.  \n5. **Return to Start:** Push off with your right heel, and return to a standing position, bringing your right foot back to starting position.  \n6. **Repeat:** Perform the same movement with your left leg. Alternate legs for the desired number of repetitions.  \n7. **Breathing:** Inhale as you lower yourself into the lunge and exhale as you push back to the standing position.",
