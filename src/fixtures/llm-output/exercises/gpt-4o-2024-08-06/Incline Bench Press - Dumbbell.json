  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Sit on an incline bench set at a 30 to 45-degree angle. Grab two dumbbells of equal weight and place them on your thighs. Lie back on the bench and position the dumbbells at shoulder width, with your arms bent at a 90-degree angle and your palms facing forward.\n\n2. **Position Your Arms:** Ensure your feet are flat on the floor. Your back should remain in contact with the bench at all times, and your shoulder blades should be retracted. This will help maintain stability and proper form.\n\n3. **Lift the Weights:** Use your thighs to help lift the dumbbells and press them over your chest. Extend your arms without locking your elbows and maintain control of the weights.\n\n4. **Control the Descent:** Slowly lower the dumbbells to the starting position. Keep your elbows at a 90-degree angle when the weights are at chest level, ensuring that the dumbbells align with your nipple line.\n\n5. **Repeat the Exercise:** Press the weights back up, following the same path, and repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Keep a controlled tempo throughout.\n\n6. **End Position:** After completing the set, carefully lower the dumbbells to your thighs and assist yourself back to a sitting position using your core muscles.",
