  "name": "Hip Thrust",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Sit on the ground with your upper back resting against a bench. Roll a loaded barbell over your legs until it is directly over your hips. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the floor, about hip-width apart.\n\n2. **Positioning**: Lean back against the bench so that the bench supports the bottom of your shoulder blades. Keep your elbows resting on the bench for support.\n\n3. **Starting Position**: Your feet should be positioned like you are about to perform a bridge, with shins vertical and feet slightly pointed outward. Ensure the bar is directly over your hips, and use a pad to cushion your hips if necessary.\n\n4. **Engagement**: Brace your core and squeeze your glutes by tilting your pelvis slightly under to engage your glutes, but keep your rib cage down.\n\n5. **The Thrust**: Drive through your heels as you lift your hips vertically. Thrust your hips up until your thighs are parallel to the ground, and your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Keep your chin tucked slightly to maintain a neutral spine.\n\n6. **Pause**: At the top of the movement, pause and squeeze your glutes for 1-2 seconds, ensuring you don't hyperextend your lower back.\n\n7. **Lowering**: Slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position.\n\n8. **Repetition**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, ensuring correct form with each rep.",
