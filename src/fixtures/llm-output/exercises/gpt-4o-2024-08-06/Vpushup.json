  "name": "Vpushup",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**: \n Begin by getting into a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your fingers facing the floor directly under your shoulders.\n Your body should form a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core muscles to maintain stability.\n\n2. **Lowering Motion**:\n Slowly lower your upper body toward the ground. Focus on bending at the elbows rather than rotating your torso or arching your back.\n\nAs you descend, keep in close proximity to the floor but maintain control over the movement and avoid touching your nose or chest to the ground.\n Lower until your upper arms are bent at an angle of about 90 degrees from the top, creating a 'V' shape with your body.\n\n3. **Push-up Motion**:\n Push back up to starting position using your hands to push off the ground rather than shoving with your shoulders or straining the lower back.\n Throughout the movement keep your core muscles engaged to support and control the exercise,\n Avoid bouncing or swinging on landing,\n\n4. **Volume**: \nPerform for a recommended number of repetitions, aiming for at least 15-20 within the workout volume, as well adjustments necessary.",
