  "name": "Abdominal Stabilization",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position:** Begin by lying on your back on a comfortable yet firm surface, such as an exercise mat.\n\n2. **Bend your Knees:** Ensure that your feet are flat on the floor, hip-width apart, and your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core:** Place your hands gently on your abdomen. Inhale deeply, and as you exhale, actively engage your abdominal muscles by pulling your navel towards your spine. Imagine your core muscles forming a protective belt around your midsection.\n\n4. **Neutral Spine:** Maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise by avoiding excessive arching or flattening of the back. The goal is to keep a natural curve that is comfortable.\n\n5. **Hold the Position:** Hold this engaged position for 5 to 10 seconds initially, ensuring consistent breathing. Gradually increase the hold time as your strength improves.\n\n6. **Relax and Repeat:** Slowly release the tension after each hold and relax your abdominal muscles. Aim for 10 to 15 repetitions, ensuring good form with each one.\n\n7. **Progression:** As your core strength increases, consider incorporating gentle movements such as lifting one foot off the ground or adding light weights to increase the challenge, ensuring you maintain stability.",
