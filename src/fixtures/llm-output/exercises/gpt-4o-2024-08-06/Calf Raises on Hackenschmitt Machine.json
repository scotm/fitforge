  "name": "Calf Raises on Hackenschmitt Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Machine:** Begin by adjusting the Hackenschmitt machine to a comfortable starting position. Make sure the platform is positioned so that when you stand on it, you can fully extend and lower your heels.\n\n2. **Position Yourself:** Step onto the platform facing the machine. Place the balls of your feet on the edge of the foot platform, allowing your heels to hang off. Keep your feet hip-width apart for balance.\n\n3. **Engage the Safety Stops:** Ensure the safety stops are engaged so that the weight will not fall unexpectedly. \n\n4. **Perform the Exercise:** \n   - **Starting Position:** Stand upright with your knees slightly bent and back straight. Grasp the machine's handles for support.\n   - **Raise Up:** Press the balls of your feet down and lift your heels as high as possible, flexing your calves. Hold the top position briefly to maximize contraction.\n   - **Lower Down:** Slowly lower your heels back down below the platform level to feel a stretch in your calves.\n\n5. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining controlled motion throughout the exercise.\n\n6. **Finish:** Safely exit the machine by stepping off when all repetitions are completed. Disengage the safety stops if necessary. Return any weight or equipment to its proper place.",
