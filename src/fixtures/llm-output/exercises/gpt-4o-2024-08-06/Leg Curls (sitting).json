  "name": "Leg Curls (sitting)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by adjusting the leg curl machine to fit your body. Set the backrest so that your knees are aligned with the pivot point of the machine. Adjust the pad so it rests comfortably against the back of your lower legs, slightly above your heels.\n\n2. Sit down on the machine and place your legs under the pad. Ensure your knees are bent at approximately 90 degrees.\n\n3. Grip the handles on the sides of the machine to stabilize your upper body and keep your back firmly pressed against the backrest.\n\n4. Begin the movement by curling your legs backward as far as you can comfortably go, focusing on squeezing your hamstrings.\n\n5. Hold the contraction at the bottom for a moment, ensuring your lower legs are as close to your thighs as possible.\n\n6. Slowly return to the starting position by extending your legs forward in a controlled manner.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining good form throughout the exercise.\n\n8. Once you complete your reps, release your legs from under the pad and stand up from the machine.",
