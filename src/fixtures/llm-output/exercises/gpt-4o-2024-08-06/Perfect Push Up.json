  "name": "Perfect Push Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by positioning yourself face down on the floor, supporting your body on your hands and toes (a typical full plank position). Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Align your body so that it forms a straight line from your head down to your heels. Engage your core muscles to maintain this rigid position throughout the exercise.\n\n3. Look slightly ahead of you to keep your neck in a neutral position. Avoid tucking your chin into your chest or excessively looking upwards.\n\n4. As you begin the push-up, lower your body toward the floor by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows tucked closely to your body as you lower yourself.\n\n5. Continue descending until your chest nearly touches the floor. Your elbows should form an approximately 90-degree angle at this lowest point.\n\n6. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, ensuring you maintain control and proper form.\n\n7. Push yourself back up by extending your elbows, returning to the starting position with your arms fully straightened.\n\n8. Throughout the motion, keep your core engaged and your body in a straight line to avoid sagging hips or a raised rear.\n\n9. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
