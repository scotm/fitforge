  "name": "Leg Raise",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie flat on your back on an exercise mat or the floor, with your legs fully extended and your arms by your sides. Keep your back flat and your body straight.\n\n2. Keep your legs straight, but if needed, a slight bend in the knees is acceptable to protect the lower back if flexibility is limited.\n\n3. Tighten your abdominal muscles by drawing your navel towards your spine. This action stabilizes your core and minimizes strain on your lower back.\n\n4. With control, lift both legs upwards, keeping them together, until they form about a 90-degree angle with your torso. Your buttocks may naturally lift slightly off the ground, but keep your lower back in contact with the floor as much as possible.\n\n5. Hold this position briefly at the top, ensuring to keep your core engaged and legs straight.\n\n6. Lower your legs back down slowly and with control to just above the mat, without letting them touch the floor, to maintain tension in your abs.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
