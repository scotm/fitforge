  "name": "Fly With Dumbbells, Decline Bench",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting a decline bench to about 15 to 30 degrees of inclination. Make sure it is securely locked in place.\n\n2. Select a pair of dumbbells of appropriate weight for your fitness level.\n\n3. Sit on the bench with the dumbbells resting on your thighs.\n\n4. Carefully lie back on the bench, bringing the dumbbells onto your chest with your arms bent and palms facing each other.\n\n5. Plant your feet firmly on the ground or use a footrest to ensure stability. Your knees should be bent at about a 90-degree angle.\n\n6. Extend your arms above your chest. Your elbows should be slightly bent, and your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This is your starting position.\n\n7. Inhale deeply and slowly lower the dumbbells out to the sides in a controlled arc, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows throughout the motion. Lower them until you feel a stretch in your chest.\n\n8. Exhale as you bring the dumbbells back to the starting position by reversing the arc motion. Focus on using your chest muscles to bring the weights up and ensure your arms remain parallel as they move.\n\n9. Squeeze your chest muscles at the top of the movement to maximize contraction.\n\n10. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\n11. Once you finish the set, bring the dumbbells back to your chest before sitting up carefully to avoid any strain on your back.",
