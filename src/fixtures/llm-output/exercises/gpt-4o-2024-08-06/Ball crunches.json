  "name": "Ball Crunches",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**: Sit on an exercise ball with both feet flat on the floor, about hip-width apart. Walk your feet out and lie back on the ball until your lower back is supported, forming a bridge with your body. Your thighs and upper body should be parallel to the floor, and your knees should be at a 90-degree angle.\n   \n2. **Body Positioning**: Place your hands behind your head, lightly supporting it but not pulling on your neck. Keep your elbows wide and open, but not so wide that they touch the floor.\n   \n3. **Execution**: Exhale and contract your abdominal muscles to lift your shoulders and upper back off the ball. Your lower back should remain in contact with the ball throughout the movement to maintain balance and support. The movement should be slow and controlled.\n   \n4. **Peak Contraction**: At the top of the movement, hold for a moment and engage your core by consciously tightening your abs. Avoid pulling on your neck.\n   \n5. **Return**: Inhale and slowly lower your shoulders and upper back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping your neck neutral.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Perform 10-15 reps depending on your fitness level, completing 2-3 sets depending on your goal and experience.\n\n**Tips**:\n- Focus on using your abs rather than momentum to lift your torso.\n- Ensure the ball remains stable throughout the exercise.\n- Keep your movements smooth and controlled for maximum efficiency.",
