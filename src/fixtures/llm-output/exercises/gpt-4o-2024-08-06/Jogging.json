Keep your body upright and your head looking forward.\n\n5. **Maintain proper form:** \n   - **Arms:** Keep your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle and swing your arms naturally with each step.\n   - **Legs:** Keep your steps short and light, focusing on landing softly on the midfoot or forefoot.\n   - **Breathing:** Inhale and exhale deeply and rhythmically to maintain a steady breath.\n\n6. **Gradually increase speed and duration:** As you become more comfortable, pick up the pace and jog for longer periods.
