  "name": "Jogging",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Warm-up**: Begin with a 5 to 10-minute warm-up to prepare your body. This can include brisk walking, dynamic stretching, or light aerobic exercises, such as side-to-side leg swings and arm circles, to increase your heart rate gradually.\n\n2. **Get into Position**: Stand upright with your feet hip-width apart. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your head looking forward. Your arms should be bent at about 90 degrees, close to your sides.\n\n3. **Start Jogging**: Begin by lightly jogging at a slow, steady pace. Start by lifting your knees slightly and swinging your arms naturally with each stride. Ensure your feet roll from heel to toe with each step.\n\n4. **Maintain Good Form**: Keep your back straight and avoid leaning too far forward or backward. Maintain a consistent breathing pattern to ensure you have enough oxygen and can maintain your pace comfortably.\n\n5. **Adjust Your Speed**: Depending on your fitness level, you can adjust your pace to suit your endurance. Start slow if you are a beginner and gradually increase the pace. Experienced joggers may incorporate intervals of faster running.\n\n6. **Keep a Consistent Pace**: Aim to maintain a steady pace throughout the jog, focusing on endurance rather than speed. Use a rhythm that allows you to jog without becoming breathless while maintaining a conversation.\n\n7. **Cool Down**: Once you complete your jogging session, cool down by slowing your pace to a walk for the last 5 to 10 minutes. This helps your body transition back to a resting state safely.\n\n8. **Stretch After Jogging**: Following your cool-down, end with a series of stretches to relax and lengthen the muscles worked during jogging. Focus on your calves, quadriceps, hamstrings, and hip flexors to reduce tension and aid recovery.",
