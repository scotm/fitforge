  "name": "Jump rope: basic jumps",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Warm-up:** Begin by warming up your body with dynamic stretches or light cardiovascular activity such as jogging in place for 5-10 minutes to prevent injury.\\n\\n2. **Choose the Right Rope:** Stand on the middle of the rope with one foot. The handles should reach up to your armpits. Adjust the length of the rope by tying knots if necessary.\\n\\n3. **Grip the Handles:** Hold the handles of the jump rope with a relaxed grip, keeping your elbows close to your body.\\n\\n4. **Position Your Body:** Stand up straight with your feet together, knees slightly bent. Your arms should be relaxed by your sides and your core engaged.\\n\\n5. **Start the Motion:** Begin by swinging the rope over your head using your wrists, not your whole arms.\\n\\n6. **Basic Jump:** As the rope passes your shins, jump over it with both feet. Keep your jumps low to the ground, only about 1-2 inches off the floor.\\n\\n7. **Establish a Rhythm:** Keep a steady and consistent rhythm, breathing normally as you continue to jump. Use a bounce at a moderate pace to maintain form and avoid fatigue.\\n\\n8. **Use Proper Form:** Land softly on the balls of your feet with your knees slightly bent to absorb the impact.\\n\\n9. **Progression:** Start with a few minutes of continuous jumping and gradually increase the duration as your stamina improves.\\n\\n10. **Cool Down:** Finish with a cool-down period, including dynamic stretches and deep breathing exercises to gradually bring your heart rate down.",
