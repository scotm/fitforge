  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Stand upright with your feet together and hold the jump rope handles, one in each hand.\n2. **Grip the handles**: Hold the handles firmly with your palms facing forward and your thumbs lightly on the top of the handles.\n3. **Starting the Rope**: Swing the rope over your head by rotating your wrists, not your whole arm. Let the rope hit the ground in front of your feet.\n4. **Jumping**: As the rope comes towards your feet, jump slightly off the ground, just high enough for the rope to pass underneath. Keep your jumps low to conserve energy.\n5. **Landing**: Land softly on the balls of your feet with your knees slightly bent to absorb the impact. This helps protect your knees and ankles.\n6. **Rhythm**: Maintain a steady, even pace. You can slightly hop from one foot to the other to keep the rhythm or perform the jumps with both feet simultaneously.\n7. **Breathing**: Remember to breathe naturally throughout the exercise, do not hold your breath.\n8. **Continuous Jumps**: Keep the jumps continuous and try to stay light on your feet.\n9. **Stopping**: Slow down your pace gradually and stop the swing of the rope by catching it under your feet or in your hands.",
