  "name": "Straight-arm Pull Down (bar Attachment)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand facing a pull-down bar attachment with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. **Grip and Hand Placement**: \n   - Grasp the attached bar firmly, using an underhand grip (palms facing away from you). Your hands should be positioned wider than shoulder-width apart, with elbows close to fully extended and arms straight.\n\n3. **Movement Initiation**:\n   - Pull down on the bar attachment with your arm and back muscles, keeping your elbows still and only moving at the shoulders. Avoid swinging motions to maintain proper technique.\n\n4. **Movement Progression**: \n   - Slowly lower yourself down toward the bar. When you reach a comfortable position where full contraction is felt in the lat muscles (just above the elbows), pause briefly to engage the muscle further if needed.\n\n5. **Return to Starting Position**:\n   - To finish, return slowly and smoothly to your arms' original straightened posture at the top of the pull-down, keeping full control throughout the range of movement.\n\n6. **Repeat or Cycle**: \n   - For optimal results, perform repetitions of this smooth, fluid motion within a predetermined rep range under your guidance or fitness goals.",
