Grasp the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing down), hands about shoulder-width apart.\n\n4. Keep your elbows close to your sides and keep them stationary throughout the movement.\n\n5. Stand upright, maintaining a slight bend in your knees and keeping your back straight.\n\n6. Begin the movement by curling the bar upwards, contracting your biceps while exhaling. Ensure that your wrists remain straight and the movement is controlled.\n\n7. Continue curling until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level.\n\n8. Hold the position for a brief second, squeezing your biceps.\n\n9. Slowly return the bar to the starting position, inhaling as you lower the weight, until your arms are fully extended.\n\n10. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
