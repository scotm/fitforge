  "name": "Benchpress Dumbbells",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Begin by lying on a flat bench with your feet firmly planted on the ground and your back flat against the bench. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, resting them on your thighs with your palms facing each other. \n\n2. **Positioning**: Use your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up so that each dumbbell is positioned at shoulder width with your palms facing forward. Your arms should be bent at roughly 90 degrees.\n\n3. **Starting Position**: Keep your wrists straight (not bent) and your elbows pointed slightly outwards. Your back should be naturally arched but not overly exaggerated, maintaining contact with the bench.\n\n4. **Execution**: Press the dumbbells upwards by extending your arms and bringing them together at the top. **Exhale** as you push.\n\n5. **Top Position**: At the top of the movement, your arms should be fully extended directly above your chest, but not locked. The dumbbells should be just a few inches apart.\n\n6. **Lowering**: **Inhale** as you slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position until your elbows form a 90-degree angle or slightly lower.\n\n7. **Completion**: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control during both the lifting and lowering phases. \n\n8. **Cooldown**: Safely return the dumbbells to your thighs and then to the floor by sitting up.\n\n**Tip**: Keep a neutral grip to ensure stability and engage core muscles to avoid overarching the back.",
