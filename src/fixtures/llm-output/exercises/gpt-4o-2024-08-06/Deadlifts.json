  "name": "Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Stance**: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outward. Position the barbell over the middle of your feet.\n\n2. **Grip**: Bend at the hips and knees to reach the bar. Grip the bar with both hands just outside of your knees. You can use a pronated grip (palms facing you) or a mixed grip (one palm facing you, one palm facing away) for better hold.\n\n3. **Back and Core**: Straighten your back and engage your core by bracing your abdominal muscles. Keep your chest up and your spine in a neutral position, avoiding any unnecessary rounding.\n\n4. **Lift**: Press through your heels and extend your hips and knees to stand up straight, lifting the barbell off the ground. Keep the barbell close to your body as you lift, and ensure your back remains straight.\n\n5. **Lockout**: At the top of the lift, fully extend your hips and knees, standing tall. Your shoulders should be back and your chest up, with your back still straight.\n\n6. **Lowering**: To lower the barbell, push your hips back first, bending at the waist and then the knees. Keep the bar close to your body as you descend. Lower the barbell in a controlled manner back to the starting position on the ground.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Reset your position if needed and repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
