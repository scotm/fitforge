  "name": "Diamond Push-Ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by kneeling on the floor and placing your hands together under your chest, with your index fingers and thumbs touching to form a diamond shape.\n\n2. Extend your legs straight back so that you are in a plank position, with your body forming a straight line from head to heels. Keep your feet together or slightly apart, with your toes on the ground.\n\n3. Engage your core by tightening your abdominal muscles, and make sure your body remains straight without sagging or arching your back.\n\n4. Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows, lowering your chest toward your hands in a controlled manner. Keep your elbows close to your body as you descend, and stop when your chest is just above your hands.\n\n5. Exhale as you press through your palms to straighten your arms, pushing your body back up to the starting position.\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining the diamond shape with your hands and a straight line from head to heels throughout the exercise.",
