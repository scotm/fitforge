  "name": "Front Raises with Plates",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a weight plate in both hands, arms extended down in front of your thighs. Your palms should be facing your thighs.\n\n2. **Grip**: Hold the top of the weight plate with an overhand grip. Keep your thumbs wrapped around for security.\n\n3. **Posture**: Keep your back straight, core engaged, and gaze forward. Your knees should be slightly bent to absorb any shock and maintain balance.\n\n4. **Lifting the Plates**: Slowly raise the weight plate directly in front of you with your arms fully extended. Keep your elbows slightly bent to reduce joint strain.\n\n5. **Stop at Shoulder Height**: Continue to lift the weight until it reaches shoulder height, or slightly above parallel to the floor. Ensure your wrists are straight and arms are parallel to the ground.\n\n6. **Pause and Squeeze**: Hold this top position for a second, squeezing the shoulder and chest muscles.\n\n7. **Lowering the Plates**: Gently lower the weight plate back to the starting position in a controlled manner. Avoid swinging or dropping the weight.\n\n8. **Breathing**: Exhale as you lift the weight up, and inhale as you lower it back down.\n\n9. **Repetitions**: Repeat for the desired number of reps, usually 8 to 12, depending on your workout plan and fitness level.",
