  "name": "Lateral Rows on Cable, One Armed",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by setting the cable machine pulley to about the height of your waist or slightly higher. Attach a single handle grip to the cable.\n\n2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and maintain a slight bend in your knees for stability.\n\n3. Grip the handle with one hand, ensuring your palm is facing you (a neutral grip). Step back slightly to create tension in the cable with your arm fully extended.\n\n4. Keep your torso upright and engage your core to stabilize your body throughout the movement.\n\n5. Start the exercise by pulling the handle towards the side of your torso, keeping your elbow close to your body. Focus on squeezing your shoulder blade towards your spine as you pull the handle.\n\n6. Your upper arm should move in a plane that is slightly below shoulder-height during the rowing motion.\n\n7. Hold the contraction for a brief moment when the handle is close to your body, then slowly extend your arm back to the starting position, controlling the resistance as you go.\n\n8. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.\n\n9. Switch to the opposite arm and repeat the same number of repetitions to ensure balanced muscle development.",
