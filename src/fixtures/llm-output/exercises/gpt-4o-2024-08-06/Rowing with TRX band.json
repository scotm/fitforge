  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by adjusting the TRX straps to a length that allows you to lean back comfortably with your arms extended, and the TRX handles are at your waist level when fully pulled.\n2. Stand facing the anchor point of the TRX. Take the handles with an overhand grip (palms facing down) with your arms fully extended in front of you.\n3. Lean back in a controlled manner, so your body is at a slight angle to the floor; your feet should be planted firmly on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and your body should be in a straight line from head to heels.\n4. Engage your core and pull your shoulder blades down and back to maintain good posture.\n5. Begin the movement by pulling the handles towards your body, bending your elbows. Your elbows should stay close to your body, and your wrists should remain straight.\n6. Pull until your hands are beside your ribs, and make sure to squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement.\n7. Pause briefly at the contraction point.\n8. Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position, maintaining control and tension throughout your arms and back.\n9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions to complete the set.",
