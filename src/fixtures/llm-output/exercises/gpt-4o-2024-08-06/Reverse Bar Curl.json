  "name": "Reverse Bar Curl",
  "how_to_perform": "**Step-by-Step Instructions**\n\n1. Stand facing a squat rack with the barbell at shoulder height, but close to your body.\n2. With your hands shoulder-width apart on the bar, take a small step forward with one foot and keep the other foot back for balance.\n3. Keeping your back straight and core engaged, hinge slightly at the hips to lift the weight off the rack.\n4. As you stand up straight, slowly curl the weight upwards by bending your elbows. Keep your upper arms still, only moving your forearms to perform the curl.\n5. Once you've curled the weight upwards as high as comfortable, hold for a brief moment (about 1-2 seconds).\n6. Slowly lower the bar behind your head and back down to the rack without bouncing or jerking the bar.\n7. Repeat on the other side by stepping forward with the opposite foot.",
