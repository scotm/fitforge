  "name": "Muscle Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Find the right equipment**: Use a sturdy pull-up bar or gymnastic rings that are high enough for your feet to hang freely off the ground.\n\n2. **Grip the bar/rings**: Stand directly under the bar and jump up to grab it with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you). Your hands should be positioned slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. **Hang and prepare**: Let your body hang freely with your arms fully extended, keeping your core tight and your legs together. This is the starting position.\n\n4. **Kip or pull explosively**: Begin by swinging your legs forward and then back to gain momentum (this is called kipping). Alternatively, if you're doing a strict muscle up, skip the swing and start pulling immediately. Use an explosive pull-up motion to begin moving your chest towards the bar.\n\n5. **Transition to a dip**: As your chest reaches the bar, tip your chest above the bar and simultaneously push the bar down. This is the technical transition from a pull-up to a dip position. Your wrists should roll over the bar as your chest goes over it.\n\n6. **Perform the dip**: Once your chest is over the bar and your elbows are bent above it, press upwards with your arms to extend them fully while pushing your upper body over the bar. This completes the dip portion of the muscle up.\n\n7. **Control the descent**: To finish a repetition, carefully lower yourself back down to the starting hanging position by reversing the movements. Bend your elbows as you bring your chest back under the bar and extend your arms fully to the initial dead hang position.\n\n8. **Repeat**: To perform multiple reps, use the momentum and technique in a controlled manner to increase fluidity and efficiency between each rep.",
