  "name": "Step-ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Choose a Step or Bench**: Choose a sturdy step or bench that allows you to place one foot on it, with your foot at the same level as your knee when standing on the ground.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: Stand in front of the step or bench with both feet on the ground. Make sure you have enough space around you for proper movement.\n\n3. **Place Foot on Step**: Place your non-dominant foot on the top of the step or bench and bring the other foot (dominant one) up to meet it, so that both feet are now on the step or bench.\n\n4. **Begin Ascent**: Start by going onto tiptoes with your non-dominant foot on the step, while keeping the dominant foot in front of you (but not yet stepping up). Gradually push off from the ground with the front leg and land softly on the top of the step or bench.\n\n5. **Push Off Ground and Stepping Down**: Push off using both feet simultaneously as one unit (the second step down) ensuring that upon landing your dominant foot starts in a position where it's forward as you begin stepping down, while keeping the back foot pushing off with force.\n\n6. **Return to Starting Position**: Ascent once more starting up on tiptoes with non-dominant and gradually push off from ground using both feet (step up) like done previously, ensure that your knees remain soft throughout this process as you will be moving rapidly back and forth using the momentum to elevate yourself while avoiding injuries.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
