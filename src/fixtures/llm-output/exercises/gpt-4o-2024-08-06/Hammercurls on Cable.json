  "name": "Hammercurls on Cable",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Cable Machine:** Attach a rope handle to the low pulley of a cable machine.\n2. **Adjust the Weight:** Select the appropriate weight on the stack that suits your strength level.\n3. **Positioning:** Stand in front of the cable machine, feet shoulder-width apart, maintaining an upright posture.\n4. **Grip the Rope:** Grab the rope with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Your hands should be at the end of the ropes.\n5. **Body Position:** Keep your elbows close to your torso and ensure they're fixed throughout the movement.\n6. **The Curl Movement:** Begin with your arms fully extended, then exhale as you curl the rope upward by flexing at the elbows. Keep your upper arms stationary.\n7. **Focus:** The movement should be slow and controlled, focusing on squeezing the biceps at the top of the curl.\n8. **Lowering the Weight:** Inhale as you slowly lower the rope back to the starting position, fully extending your arms.\n9. **Repetitions:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining form throughout each curl.\n\nEnsure you donâ€™t use momentum to lift the weights; this might reduce the effectiveness and could cause injury.",
