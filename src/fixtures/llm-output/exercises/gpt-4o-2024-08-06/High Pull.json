  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by standing with your feet hip-width apart. Hold a barbell with an overhand grip, your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width, and let it hang in front of you at arm's length.\n2. Engage your core and keep your chest lifted as you bend your knees slightly, lowering into a shallow squat position. Your upper body should lean forward slightly from the hips, not the waist.\n3. In one explosive movement, drive through your heels and extend your hips and knees to stand up straight, pulling the barbell vertically along your body, leading with your elbows.\n4. As you rise, your elbows should be higher than your hands at all times.\n5. Continue to pull the bar upwards until it rises towards your chest or chin level.\n6. Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position with controlled movement, returning to the slight squat position.\n7. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.",
