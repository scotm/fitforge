  "name": "Biceps Curls With Barbell",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a barbell with both hands, palms facing forward and spaced shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Start with your arms fully extended down, the barbell resting against your thighs. Keep your elbows close to your torso.\n\n3. Take a deep breath and brace your core, ensuring your back remains straight.\n\n4. Begin to curl the bar upward by flexing your elbows. Focus on contracting your bicep muscles.\n\n5. Lift the barbell up to shoulder level while keeping your upper arms stationary. Only your forearms should move during this motion.\n\n6. Pause briefly at the top of the lift, squeezing your biceps.\n\n7. Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position, keeping your movements controlled to engage the muscles effectively.\n\n8. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions, typically 8-12 for muscle growth.\n\n9. Ensure controlled breathing throughout the exercise: exhale when lifting the bar and inhale when lowering it.",
