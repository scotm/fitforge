  "name": "Prone Scapular Retraction - Arms at Side",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying face down (prone) on a flat surface, such as a mat or bench. \n2. Position your arms alongside your body, with palms facing downward or slightly inward towards your hips.\n3. Keep your legs straight and your forehead resting gently on the surface to keep your neck aligned with your spine.\n4. Inhale deeply to prepare for the movement.\n5. As you exhale, engage your back muscles and squeeze your shoulder blades (scapula) together and down towards your spine. Focus on moving from the scapular region rather than lifting the arms high.\n6. Your arms should lift slightly off the ground as a result of the scapular retraction, but the emphasis should be on the shoulder blades moving, not on how high the arms lift.\n7. Hold the retracted position for 1-2 seconds, feeling the contraction in your upper back.\n8. Slowly release the tension as you bring your shoulder blades back to the starting position, allowing your arms to lower gently down.\n9. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, typically around 10-15 reps depending on your training plan.",
