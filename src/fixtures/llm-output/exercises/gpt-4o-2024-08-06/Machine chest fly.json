  "name": "Machine Chest Fly",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Seat and Handles:** Start by setting the machine to your desired settings. Adjust the seat height so that the handles are at chest level. Ensure that the back pad is comfortably supporting your back.\n\n2. **Select the Weight:** Set the appropriate weight that you can control. It's better to start with a lighter weight to make sure you can perform the exercise with proper form.\n\n3. **Position Your Body:** Sit on the machine with your back fully supported by the back pad. Place your feet flat on the floor, about shoulder-width apart.\n\n4. **Grip the Handles:** Reach out and grasp the handles with a slight bend at the elbows. Your palms should be facing forward or towards each other depending on the machine design.\n\n5. **Start the Movement:** Begin the exercise by pressing the handles forward and towards each other in an arc-like motion, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows throughout to focus the tension on the chest muscles instead of the arms.\n\n6. **Contract your Chest:** As you bring the handles together in front of your chest, squeeze your chest muscles tightly.\n\n7. **Control the Return:** Slowly and with control, allow the handles to move back to the starting position, feeling a stretch across the chest. Avoid letting the weight plates touch if it is a weight stack machine; this keeps tension on your muscles.\n\n8. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control and proper form throughout each rep.\n\n9. **Rest:** After completing a set, rest for 30-60 seconds before beginning your next set.",
