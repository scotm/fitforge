  "name": "Hanging Leg Raises",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by hanging from a pull-up bar or a set of parallel bars. Grip the bar with an overhand grip, with your hands about shoulder-width apart. Keep your arms straight.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button in toward your spine. Ensure that your legs are fully extended.\n\n3. Initiate the leg raise by keeping your legs straight and lifting them upwards, keeping feet together. Raise them until your legs are parallel to the ground or higher, depending on flexibility and strength, while maintaining a slight bend at the knees to avoid locking joints.\n\n4. As you lift your legs, keep your upper body stable and avoid swinging or using momentum. Focus on using your abdominal muscles to control the lift.\n\n5. Hold at the top for a moment, feeling the contraction in your core muscles.\n\n6. Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position with control. Do not allow them to drop quickly.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of reps.",
