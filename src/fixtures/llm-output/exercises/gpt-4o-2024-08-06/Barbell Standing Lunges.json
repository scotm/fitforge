  "name": "Barbell Standing Lunges",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Begin by standing upright with your feet hip-width apart. Position a barbell across your upper back, securing it with both hands in a pronated grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width.\n\n2. **Start Position**: Engage your core and keep your chest lifted. Look forward to maintain a neutral spine throughout the exercise.\n\n3. **Lunge Movement**: Step forward with one leg, approximately 2-3 feet from your starting position, and lower your hips so that your front knee is bent at approximately a 90-degree angle. The back knee should also point towards the ground but should not touch it.\n\n4. **Ensure Proper Form**: Keep your front knee directly above the ankle and avoid letting it extend past the toes. Your torso should remain upright, and your back should be straight.\n\n5. **Return to Standing**: Push through the heel of your forward foot to extend the knees and hips, stepping back to the original standing position.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Alternate legs for each lunge, ensuring equal repetitions on both sides to maintain balance and muscle symmetry.\n\n7. **Breathing**: Inhale as you step into the lunge and exhale as you push back to the standing position.\n\n8. **Repetition and Sets**: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions on each leg, depending on your fitness level.",
