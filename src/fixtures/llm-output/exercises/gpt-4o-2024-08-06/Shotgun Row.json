  "name": "Shotgun Row",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Place an adjustable bench or a stable surface in front of you. \n   Place your feet on the ground with your dominant side closest to the bench.\n\n2. **Erg Positioning and Grip Setup**:\n   - Sit up straight on the bench, engaging your core and maintaining good posture.\n   Hold a barbell or dumbbells with your hands shoulder-width apart. Ensure your palms are facing each other (neutral grip) at the height of your shoulders.\n\n3. **Rowing Movement**:\n   - Keeping your back straight, bend your knees slightly and lean forward while keeping your core engaged. \n\n4. **Key Positions and Muscle Engagement**: Rotate your torso as you hinge forward. \n   - Lower down to row a shoulder-wide grip with 1 arm toward the opposite hip at about thigh level. You will essentially feel an isolation effect in your upper trap.\n    Press your upper back into the bench for better scapular stability while keeping your lower back grounded. \n\n5. **Retrieving and Returning**: Now return to your initial standing starting position. As you straighten, pull both shoulders up toward their respective ears.\n\n6. **Final Reps**:\n   - Perform this series of rows by targeting left and right sides simultaneously for every repetition, or if not possible due to injury prevention issues, proceed rowing one hand at a time in each rep, switching hands between upper body exercises like squats, lunges, etc.",
