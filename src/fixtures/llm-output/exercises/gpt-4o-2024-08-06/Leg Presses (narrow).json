  "name": "Leg Press (Narrow Stance)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Adjust the seat of the leg press machine so that your back and head are comfortably supported, and your knees can bend to a 90-degree angle at the bottom of the movement. Place your feet close together, about hip-width apart or narrower, on the footplate. Make sure your heels are flat and your toes are pointing slightly outward. \n\n2. **Starting Position:** Sit down on the machine and press your back firmly against the back rest. Ensure your legs are extended but not completely locked at the knees. Your feet should be close together on the lower half of the footplate for the narrow stance. Grasp the side handles to stabilize your upper body.\n\n3. **Initiating the Movement:** Engage your core muscles and, slowly and with control, unlock the safety pins to release the weight. Begin to lower the weight by bending your knees towards your chest. Keep your feet flat on the footplate.\n\n4. **Lowering Phase:** Lower the platform in a controlled manner until your knees are at approximately a 90-degree angle and your thighs are parallel with the foot plate. Avoid allowing your lower back to round or your heels to lift off the footplate as you lower.\n\n5. **Pressing Phase:** Push through your heels to extend your knees and press the platform back to the starting position. Do this movement with power but without locking out your knees at the top to maintain tension in the muscles.\n\n6. **Repetitions:** Complete the desired number of repetitions, ensuring you maintain good form throughout the set. Safety always comes first, so keep a controlled tempo and avoid letting your knees move inward or outward during the press.\n\n7. **Finishing the Exercise:** Once you have completed your set, carefully re-engage the safety mechanisms to lock the weight into place.",
