  "name": "Tibialis Raises",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by sitting or standing on a stable surface, depending on your preference.\n\n2. Identify the tibialis muscles in both your lower legs. You can do this by lifting one of your legs out to the side and feeling the muscle contract as it raises.\n\n3. Lift each foot individually off the ground by contracting the tibialis anterior muscles. Press your toes downward into a small plate or footplate, engaging the muscles fully.\n\n4. Hold for a brief moment (about 1 second) with both feet raised. Engage your core and maintain a stable position throughout.\n\n5. Lower your foot back down to the starting position without touching it to the ground. Lift again immediately after reaching the bottom of the movement.\n\n6. Continue alternating legs, doing raises on each leg for several repetitions before moving on to the next exercise.",
