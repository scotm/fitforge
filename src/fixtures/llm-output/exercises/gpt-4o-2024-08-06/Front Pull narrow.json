  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Stand in front of a cable machine with a narrow bar attachment placed at about shoulder height.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar:** Grasp the attachment closely with an overhand grip, with your hands positioned close together, about 4-6 inches apart. Your palms should be facing down.\n\n3. **Position Yourself:** Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Take a couple of small steps back to ensure the weights are pulled off the stack.\n\n4. **Engage Core:** Keep your core tight throughout the exercise to stabilize your body and support your back. Slightly bend your knees to aid balance.\n\n5. **Start the Pull:** Begin with your arms extended in front of you and the weight in a slightly straightened but still natural position.\n\n6. **Pull:** Using your upper back muscles, pull the handle towards your torso. Ensure your elbows move straight back along your body and your shoulder blades pinch together, keeping the elbows close to the sides.\n\n7. **Contract at End:** As the handle approaches your chest, focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together and holding the end position for a moment.\n\n8. **Return:** Slowly extend your arms back to the starting position and control the movement. Avoid any sudden or jerky movements.\n\n9. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, typically 8-12 for general strength training.",
