  "name": "Leg Raises on Pull-Up Bar",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand under a sturdy pull-up bar and grab it with both hands using an overhand grip. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Hang from the bar with your feet off the ground and your body fully extended. Your arms should be straight and your core engaged to prevent any swinging. This is your starting position.\n\n3. Keeping your legs together and as straight as possible, engage your core and hip flexors to slowly raise your legs up in front of you. Aim to bring them up to a 90-degree angle with your torso, so they are parallel to the ground.\n\n4. Hold the position for a brief second while contracting your abdominal muscles, ensuring that you maintain control and do not swing.\n\n5. Slowly lower your legs back to the starting position in a controlled manner, fully extending them without letting your body swing.\n\n6. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
