  "name": "Dumbbell Preacher Curl on Scott Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Begin by adjusting the seat height of the Scott curl bench (also known as a preacher bench) so that your armpits are comfortably resting at the top of the pad. This positioning allows your elbows and upper arms to be fully supported by the pad.\n\n2. **Select Your Weights:** Choose a pair of dumbbells that are appropriate for your strength and experience level. It's important to start with a lighter weight if you're new to this exercise to ensure proper form.\n\n3. **Position Yourself:** Sit on the bench and grasp a dumbbell in each hand using an underhand grip (palms facing up). Lean forward slightly so your chest is flat against the bench pad and stabilize your arms on the preacher pad. Your upper arms should be fully supported. Adjust your body so that your feet are flat on the floor and shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n4. **Starting Position:** Let your arms hang down fully extended. This is your starting position. Ensure your body and shoulders remain stable throughout the movement, avoiding any swaying or rocking with your body.\n\n5. **Execute the Curl:** While keeping your upper arms stationary and elbows firmly on the pad, curl the dumbbells up towards your shoulders by slowly contracting your biceps. Maintain focus on keeping a stable wrist position throughout the movement.\n\n6. **Peak Contraction:** Hold at the top of the curl for a moment when your biceps are fully contracted. Squeeze your biceps to maximize the contraction.\n\n7. **Lower the Weights:** Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, ensuring your muscles stay engaged even on the way down. Avoid letting the weights drop quickly, maintaining controlled tension.\n\n8. **Repetition:** Repeat the curling motion for the desired number of repetitions, typically 8-12 for muscle hypertrophy.\n\n9. **Rest and Recover:** Once you've completed a set, rest for 30-90 seconds depending on your fitness goals.\n\n10. **Repeat Sets:** Perform your target number of sets, usually 3-4, while maintaining proper form throughout the exercise.",
