  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Bench**: Set an adjustable bench to a decline position, typically around 30 to 45 degrees below horizontal.\n\n2. **Select Your Weights**: Choose a pair of dumbbells that will allow you to perform the exercise with proper form.\n\n3. **Position Yourself on the Bench**: Sit on the decline bench and place your feet securely under the foot pads, if available. Carefully lie back with a dumbbell in each hand. Your head should be at the lower end of the bench, with your feet providing stability at the top.\n\n4. **Grab the Dumbbells**: Hold the dumbbells with a firm grip and position them at chest level, palms facing forward. Your elbows should be bent at roughly 90 degrees.\n\n5. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body during the lift.\n\n6. **Press the Dumbbells**: Exhale as you extend your arms, pressing the dumbbells upward and slightly together. Your arms should be straight but not locked at the top of the movement.\n\n7. **Lower the Dumbbells**: Inhale as you slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, keeping your elbows at approximately 90 degrees or slightly lower.\n\n8. **Repeat the Exercise**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control throughout the movement to avoid swinging or jerking motions.\n\n9. **Complete Your Set**: Once you've finished, carefully lower the dumbbells to your thighs and then safely sit up to place them on the floor or a rack.",
