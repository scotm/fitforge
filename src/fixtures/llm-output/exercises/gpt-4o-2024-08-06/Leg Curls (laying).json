  "name": "Lying Leg Curls",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Position Yourself on the Machine**: Lie down on the leg curl machine, face down, with your knees just off the edge of the bench. Ensure your legs are fully extended with the pads resting against your lower calf, just about an inch above your shoes.\n\n2. **Adjust the Machine**: Make sure that the leg curl machine is adjusted to fit your height. The pad should rest comfortably above your heels without any discomfort.\n\n3. **Set Your Body Alignment**: Grip the handles on the front of the machine for stability. Your hips and chest should remain flat against the bench throughout the movement.\n\n4. **Start Position**: Keeping your legs straight, your toes should be pointing slightly away from you. Maintain a neutral spine and keep your head in line with your torso.\n\n5. **Begin the Curl**: Exhale and slowly curl your legs upwards by contracting your hamstrings. Keep your toes flexed towards your shins to activate more muscle fibers. Make sure your hips remain flat against the bench.\n\n6. **Reach the Top Position**: Continue to curl your legs until you reach the maximum range of motion â€” usually when your heels are close to your glutes. Avoid arching your back.\n\n7. **Pause and Squeeze**: Briefly hold the top position, squeezing your hamstrings to maximize the contraction.\n\n8. **Lower the Legs**: Inhale as you slowly lower your legs back to the starting position, ensuring that the movement is controlled to maintain muscle tension.\n\n9. **Repeat**: Complete the desired number of repetitions, maintaining controlled motion and breathing throughout the exercise.",
