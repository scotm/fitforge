  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and place a dumbbell on either side of your feet.\n\n2. Bend at the hips and knees to lower your body down and grab the handles of the dumbbells using a firm grip. Ensure your back remains straight.\n\n3. Engage your core muscles and lift the dumbbells off the ground by standing back up. Use your legs to lift, not your back, keeping the dumbbells close to your sides.\n\n4. Once standing, adjust your posture: stand tall with your chest up, shoulders back, and eyes facing forward. Maintain a neutral spine and engaged core throughout the exercise.\n\n5. Begin walking forward by taking small, controlled steps, ensuring that the dumbbells remain by your sides and do not sway.\n\n6. Walk a set distance or time (for example, 30 yards or 30 seconds) while maintaining proper posture and breathing steadily.\n\n7. Once you reach the end of your set distance, stop, and place the dumbbells back on the ground by bending at the hips and knees, maintaining a straight back throughout.\n\n8. Rest and repeat for the desired number of sets.",
