Ensure proper balance and stability.\n\n2. **Key Alignment**:\n   - Your weight should be evenly distributed between both legs.\n   - Keep your back straight and core engaged to maintain proper posture.\n\n3. **Lowering Phase**: \n   Begin by bending at the knees, sliding your feet slightly further apart as you lower your body down into a squat position. Lower until your thighs are close to parallel with the ground.\n\n4. **Bottom Position**:\n   - Keep your back still straight and core engaged.\n   - Aim to keep your chest up and shoulder blades back for proper form.\n\n5. **Pushing Phase**: \n   - Push through your heels, extending at the knees as you lift yourself back up to the initial standing position.\n   - Avoid bouncing or jerking movements, especially when rising from a low squat position.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Repeat squats in quick succession, maintaining control and focusing on proper form for each squat performed.",
