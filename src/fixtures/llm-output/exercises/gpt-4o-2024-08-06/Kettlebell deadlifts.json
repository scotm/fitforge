  "name": "Kettlebell Deadlifts",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Place the kettlebell on the ground between your feet. \n\n2. Engage your core and keep your back straight. Hinge at your hips by pushing your hips back, bending your knees slightly as you do so to lower your torso towards the kettlebell.\n\n3. Keep your head in a neutral position by looking forward, not down.\n\n4. Grip the kettlebell handle firmly with both hands, keeping your arms straight.\n\n5. Press your heels into the ground and engage your glutes and hamstrings to start lifting the kettlebell.\n\n6. As you lift, extend your hips and knees simultaneously, pulling the kettlebell upwards while keeping your back straight. \n\n7. Once you are back in a standing position with the kettlebell hanging in front of your thighs, pause for a moment, ensuring your shoulders are back and your core is engaged.\n\n8. Lower the kettlebell back to the ground by reversing the movement: push your hips back, bend your knees slightly, and keep your back straight until the kettlebell is back on the ground.\n\n9. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
