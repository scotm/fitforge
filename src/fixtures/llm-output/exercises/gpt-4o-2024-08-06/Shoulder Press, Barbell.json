  "how_to_perform": "1. **Equipment Setup**:\n   - Choose a barbell with an appropriate weight for your fitness level.\n   - Position yourself in front of the barbell rack or have a partner load it to your desired weight.\n\n2. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand over the barbell, gripping each side of the bar with an overhand grip that's slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. **Initial Movement**:\n   - Take a deep breath and lift the bar off the rack by extending your arms fully overhead, keeping your core engaged for good posture.\n\n4. **Pressing Motion**:\n   - Press down on the bar to lower it behind your head, squeezing your upper back muscles.\n   - From this position, press upwards and forward with the bar until it reaches the apex of its extension above your head.\n   - Keep in mind to avoid letting your arms straighten completely at the bottom of the movement.\n\n5. **Return to Starting Position**:\n   - Slowly lower the bar behind your back once more by bending your elbows, keeping them close to a 90-degree angle as you descend.\n\n6. **Repeat**:\n   - Perform two sets and a total of eight to twelve repetitions, giving control and emphasis on proper form throughout each repetition.",
