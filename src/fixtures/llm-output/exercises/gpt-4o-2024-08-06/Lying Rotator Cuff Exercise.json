  "name": "Lying Rotator Cuff Exercise",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Lie on your right side on a flat surface such as a mat or the floor, with your knees slightly bent for stability. Place a small towel roll or cushion under your right armpit for support.\n\n2. **Position Your Arm**: Bend your left elbow at a 90-degree angle, keeping it tucked into your side with your forearm resting on your abdomen. Your left hand should be in a neutral position, thumb facing up.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core muscles to maintain stability. This will help prevent any unwanted rotation of your torso during the exercise.\n\n4. **Lift Your Forearm**: Keeping your elbow tightly against your side, slowly lift your left forearm upward in an arc-like motion by rotating your shoulder. Your forearm should move away from your abdomen as far as comfortably possible without causing any strain or discomfort in your shoulder.\n\n5. **Control the Movement**: Pause for a moment at the top of the movement, ensuring you do not lose control or let the motion become jerky.\n\n6. **Return to Start**: Slowly lower your forearm back to the starting position, maintaining the 90-degree angle at your elbow throughout the movement.\n\n7. **Repetitions**: Perform 10-15 repetitions. After completing the set, switch sides and repeat the exercise with your right arm by lying on your left side. Rest after a complete set of repetitions on both sides.",
