  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Lie flat on your back on a mat, with your legs extended and arms at your sides. Alternatively, place your hands under your glutes for support. Keep your lower back pressed into the mat.\n\n2. **Engage Core**: Tighten your abdominal muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine. Ensure your lower back remains in contact with the mat throughout the exercise.\n\n3. **Leg Lift**: Lift both legs off the ground a few inches. Ensure your knees are straight and your toes are pointed away from your body.\n\n4. **Flutter Motion**: Begin the exercise by lowering one leg towards the ground as you simultaneously lift the other leg. This creates a fluttering motion. Keep alternating the legs in a smooth, controlled manner, like kicking with your toes at the surface of water.\n\n5. **Breathing**: Maintain a steady breathing pattern throughout. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.\n\n6. **Repetitions**: Continue the motion for the desired number of repetitions or duration, usually starting with 20-30 seconds or 10-15 repetitions each leg.\n\n7. **Ending the Exercise**: To finish, slowly lower both legs to the ground and relax your muscles.",
