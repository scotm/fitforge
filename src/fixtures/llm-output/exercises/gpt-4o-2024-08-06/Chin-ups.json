  "name": "Chin-ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Find a pull-up bar**: Locate a pull-up bar or a sturdy horizontal bar that is high enough for you to hang from without your feet touching the ground.\n2. **Grip the bar with a supinated grip**: Stand under the bar and reach up to grab it with an underhand grip (palms facing towards you). Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart.\n3. **Hang with arms fully extended**: Lift your feet off the ground and hang from the bar with your arms fully extended. Engage your core by slightly bending your knees and crossing your ankles.\n4. **Pull yourself up**: Begin the exercise by pulling your body up towards the bar. Focus on using your back and arm muscles to lift yourself up until your chin is above the bar.\n5. **Pause at the top**: Once your chin is above the bar, pause for a moment to squeeze your shoulder blades together.\n6. **Lower yourself down slowly**: Slowly lower your body back to the starting position with your arms fully extended. This controlled descent increases the effectiveness of the exercise.\n7. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions. Ensure that each repetition involves a full range of motion from a dead hang to chin above the bar.",
