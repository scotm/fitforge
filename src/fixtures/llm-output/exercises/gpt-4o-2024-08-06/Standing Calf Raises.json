  "name": "Standing Calf Raises",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**: \n   - **Stand on a flat surface with a slight incline** or using a step (optional).\n   - Ensure your feet are shoulder-width apart, toes pointing forward.\n   - Keep a straight back, engage your core, and maintain balance.\n\n2. **Lift and Lower**: \n   - Slowly lift yourself up by raising your heels off the ground. This should be done in a controlled manner, keeping your knees straight wherever possible.\n   - As you raise up, keep tension on your calf muscles (gastrocnemius) without bouncing or jerking the movement.\n\n3. **Depth and Control**: \n   - Continue lifting until you feel your calf muscles fully engage. The ideal range aims for partial to full contraction depending on individual goals and strength levels.\n   - Pause briefly before lowering back down.\n\n4. **Repeat**: \n   - Perform the movement for the recommended number of repetitions, maintaining control throughout the exercise.",
