  "name": "Crunches on Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Machine**: Begin by adjusting the seat and backrest of the crunch machine so that when you sit, your back is pressed comfortably against the back pad and your feet are firmly planted on the foot supports. Ensure the shoulder pads or hand grips are positioned so that they are comfortable and within reach when seated.\n\n2. **Select Resistance Level**: Set the weight stack or resistance level to a manageable amount for your fitness level, allowing you to complete the desired number of reps with good form.\n\n3. **Position Yourself**: Sit down on the machine and ensure your feet and legs are secured under the footpad, if applicable. Hold the handles or shoulder pads as provided by the machine’s design.\n\n4. **Correct Posture**: Keep your spine straight, and engage your core by slightly contracting your abdominal muscles. Ensure your lower back is supported firmly by the seat back.\n\n5. **Perform the Crunch**: Begin the exercise by exhaling and using your abdominal muscles to pull your upper body forward and downward. Focus on using only your core muscles, rather than relying on your arms or legs to assist in the movement.\n\n6. **Control the Movement Downward**: Once you’ve reached the full crunch position that comfortably contracts your abs without straining, pause for a moment.\n\n7. **Slowly Return to Start**: Inhale as you slowly and with control return to the starting position without letting the weight stack rest completely between repetitions.\n\n8. **Repeat**: Aim for 8 to 12 repetitions per set depending on your workout plan, ensuring each movement is controlled and focused on the abdominals. Increase resistance as you progress and become more confident.",
