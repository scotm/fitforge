  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, ensuring that your stance is stable.\n2. Hold the kettlebell by the handle with both hands, palms facing upward (supinated grip), and arms extended down in front of your thighs.\n3. Ensure your elbows are close to your body. This will prevent cheating through swinging movements and will engage the biceps more effectively.\n4. Keep your back straight, chest up, and shoulders back, maintaining good posture throughout the exercise.\n5. Contract your biceps to curl the kettlebell upwards, keeping your elbows stationary and close to your body. Focus on lifting with your arms, not your shoulders or back.\n6. Once the kettlebell reaches chest height, or as far as comfortable, pause for a moment to squeeze the biceps.\n7. Slowly lower the kettlebell back to the starting position, fully extending your arms to complete one repetition.\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form.\n",
