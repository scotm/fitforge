  "name": "Standing Leg Curls",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by adjusting the leg curl machine to the appropriate height. The padding should sit comfortably against the back of your lower leg just above the ankle.\n\n2. Stand facing the machine or wall for support, keeping your torso upright and your knees slightly bent.\n\n3. Hook the back of one ankle under the padded lever of the machine if using a standing leg curl machine. If no machine is used, you can wear ankle weights for resistance. \n\n4. Engage your core and keep your supporting foot planted firmly on the ground.\n\n5. Slowly curl your leg upwards by bringing your heel towards your buttocks, keeping the movement controlled. Avoid bringing your knee forward.\n\n6. Squeeze your hamstring at the top of the movement.\n\n7. Pause briefly and then slowly lower your leg back down to the starting position, resisting the weight as it lowers.\n\n8. Complete the desired number of repetitions on one leg before switching to the other leg.",
