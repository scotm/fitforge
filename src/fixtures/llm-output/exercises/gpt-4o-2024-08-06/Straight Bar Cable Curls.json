  "name": "Straight Bar Cable Curls",
  "how_to_perform": "**Instructions**\n\n1. **Equipment Setup**: Install a high-low cable attachment on each side of the workout station.\n\n2. **Starting Position**:\n\n* Stand facing the cables with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your knees slightly bent for balance.\n\n3. **Grip the Bar**: Grip the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing towards you). Make sure your hands are not too wide on the bar; rather, aim to have your elbows in line with the cables when holding the bar correctly.\n\n4. **Cable Positioning**:\n\n* The top of the bar should be positioned at or slightly above mid-chest level (around 48-52 inches, depending on user height). Adjust as necessary for proper form and comfortable reach.\n\n5. **Movement**: Stand upright with your core engaged. Slowly curl both arms up while keeping the upper arms still. Ensure you keep the elbows close to your body. Focus on contracting and then fully flexing your biceps. Reach the peak contraction when your palms are facing forward (just past 90 degrees).\n\n6. **Lowering Phase**: After a brief hold at full contraction, slowly lower the bar back down to the starting position.\n\n7. Perform the desired number of repetitions and maintain control throughout.",
