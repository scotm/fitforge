  "name": "Snatch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: \n   - Choose a weightlifting bar and attach the proper Olympic plates to it.\n   - Stand in front of the bar with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding the bar with an overhand grip.\n\n2. **Lift-off**:\n   - Lift the bar off the ground by straightening your torso and squeezing your lats together. \n   - Take a brief moment at the top to ensure you have proper posture and control throughout the lift.\n\n3. **Hinge and Lower**:\n   - From the lifted position, begin to hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight.\n   - Rotate your body so that the bar stays close to your shins as you lower yourself down. \n   - Keep your core muscles tight, avoiding any unnecessary bending or flexing in the middle.\n\n4. **Catch and Reset**:\n   - Lower the weight until a slight stretch develops between your glutes and hamstrings, but avoid completely extending that position.\n   - Catch the bar back at its initial position by reversing the movement described in step 3.\n   - Stand straight up after lowering the weight to prepare for repetition.\n\n5. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat this cycle of lifting off, hinging down, and catching for multiple repetitions as desired.",
