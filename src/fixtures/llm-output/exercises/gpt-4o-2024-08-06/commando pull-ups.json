  "how_to_perform": "1. **Find a Pull-Up Bar**: Use a sturdy pull-up bar that can support your full body weight. Ideally, the bar should be clear from obstructions around it.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar**: Position yourself such that you stand to one side of the pull-up bar. Reach up with both hands and place one hand in front of the other along the bar so that your palms face each other. This is a neutral grip.\n\n3. **Hang from the Bar**: Engage your core and hang from the bar with extended arms. Your feet should be off the ground, and your legs relatively straight and close together to maintain alignment.\n\n4. **Initiate the Pull-Up**: Start by pulling yourself up with the leading arm (the arm positioned in front on the bar), while also pulling with the trailing arm. This will bring your head and torso towards the side of the leading arm.\n\n5. **Reach the Top Position**: Continue pulling yourself upwards until your chin is just above the bar. Your head will generally pass to the side of the bar, close to the leading arm.\n\n6. **Descend Back Down**: Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position with control. Try to keep your movement steady without swinging or jerking.\n\n7. **Switch Grip**: Once you complete repetitions on one side, switch your hand positions so the trailing hand becomes the leading hand and repeat the steps.\n\n8. **Complete Sets**: Perform the desired number of repetitions and sets on both sides for a balanced workout.",
