  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start Position**: Stand tall with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Engage your core muscles to maintain balance.\n\n2. **Preparation**: Shift your weight onto the supporting leg (usually the right leg). Lift your opposite leg (the left leg) slowly and extend it straight behind you. Aim to keep this leg parallel to the ground.\n\n3. **Execute the Pose**: While raising your back leg, simultaneously lean your torso forward over the supporting leg. Aim to have your upper body and raised leg form a straight line, almost parallel to the floor. Remember to keep your supporting leg slightly bent to continue maintaining balance and stability.\n\n4. **Arm Position**: Your arms can be extended forward in line with your body, or for added difficulty, you can bring them to a high fifth position above your head. Keep them outstretched to aid in balancing.\n\n5. **Hold the Position**: Maintain this posture by keeping your core engaged and focus on a point in front of you to steady your gaze. Hold the position for 10-15 seconds.\n\n6. **Returning to Start**: Slowly lower your leg back to the starting position and bring your torso upright. Repeat the movement with the opposite leg for balance.",
