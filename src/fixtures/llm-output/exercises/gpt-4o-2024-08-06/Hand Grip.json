  "name": "Hand Grip",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Select a hand gripper**: Choose a hand grip strengthener that matches your current strength level. It can be an adjustable grip strengthener or a spring-based hand gripper that you squeeze with your hand.\n\n2. **Hold the gripper**: Take the hand gripper in one hand. Hold it so that the handles are in the palm of your hand with the spring facing upwards.\n\n3. **Grip position**: Ensure your fingers wrap around one handle and your palm and thumb press against the other handle. Position your hand so that your fingers are slightly on one end of the gripper and your thumb is positioned on the opposite end.\n\n4. **Squeeze the gripper**: Begin by squeezing the gripper as tightly as you can. Your fingers should move towards your palm, pressing the handles of the gripper together. Hold this position gently but firmly for about 3-5 seconds.\n\n5. **Release slowly**: Gradually release the pressure and allow the gripper to open back to its starting position. Try to do this slowly and with control.\n\n6. **Repeat**: Complete 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions on each hand, depending on your strength and fitness level. Rest for 30 to 60 seconds between sets.\n\n7. **Switch hands**: After completing the sets with one hand, switch to the other hand and repeat the process.\n\n8. **Cool down**: Once you have finished, stretch your fingers and wrists lightly to prevent stiffness.",
