  "name": "Preacher Curls",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Adjust the preacher curl bench so that when seated, your upper arms will lay flat against the padding with your elbows aligned near the top edge of the pad. You should be able to rest your armpits comfortably at the top of the pad.\n\n2. Choose a suitable barbell or EZ curl bar with the appropriate weight. You can also use dumbbells if preferred.\n\n3. Take a seat on the preacher bench and plant your feet firmly on the ground, about shoulder-width apart for stability.\n\n4. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip (palms facing up), hands spaced about shoulder-width apart. If using a barbell, your grip should be equal on both sides. If using an EZ curl bar, your hands should be on the angled grips.\n\n5. Start with your arms fully extended, but keep your elbows slightly flexed to maintain tension on your biceps. The bar should not be resting on the pad.\n\n6. Take a deep breath and slowly curl the weight up by bending your elbows, keeping your upper arms stationary against the pad. Focus on squeezing your biceps as you lift.\n\n7. Continue lifting until your forearms are perpendicular to the floor or slightly beyond, but don't let your elbows shift up from the pad. Your biceps should feel fully contracted.\n\n8. Pause briefly at the top of the curl, squeezing your biceps.\n\n9. Slowly lower the bar back to the starting position in a controlled manner, extending your arms until your elbows are just slightly bent to avoid locking out.\n\n10. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions. Maintain a smooth and steady pace throughout the movement.",
