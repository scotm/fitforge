  "name": "Handstand Push-Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Warm Up:** Always start with a comprehensive warm-up of the shoulders, wrists, and core to prevent injury. Consider dynamic stretches and wrist rotations.\n\n2. **Set Up:** Find a flat, sturdy wall to assist with balance. Stand about one foot away, facing the wall. \n\n3. **Position Your Hands:** Place your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, a few inches from the base of the wall.\n\n4. **Kick Up:** With a strong kick, simultaneously press one leg up followed by the other to get into a handstand position against the wall. Your body should be straight with heels touching the wall for support.\n\n5. **Engage Core and Glutes:** Keep your core engaged and glutes tight to maintain a stiff, vertical alignment.\n\n6. **Lower Down:** Slowly bend at the elbows to lower your head towards the floor in a controlled motion. Keep your elbows slightly in front of your hands and aiming away from the wall to maintain balance.\n\n7. **Touch and Push Back Up:** Lower until your head lightly touches the ground. Immediately push back up by extending your arms to return to the starting handstand position.\n\n8. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions while maintaining form.\n\n9. **Safely Dismount:** Carefully lower one foot at a time back to the ground, or cartwheel out of the handstand to finish.",
