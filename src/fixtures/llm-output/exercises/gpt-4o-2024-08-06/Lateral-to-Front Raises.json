  "name": "Lateral-to-Front Raises",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and hold a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip. Let your arms hang down at your sides, with your palms facing your body. This is the starting position. \n\n2. Keep your core engaged and chest lifted throughout the exercise to maintain good posture.\n\n3. Begin the movement by simultaneously raising both arms outwards to the sides until they reach shoulder level, ensuring that your arms stay straight but not locked during the movement. Your body should form a 'T' shape at the top of the movement.\n\n4. Pause briefly at the top to maintain tension, then bring your arms forward to shoulder height in front of you, again maintaining a straight line and level shoulders throughout.\n\n5. Hold this front position for a moment to emphasize control, then slowly lower your arms back down to your sides to return to the starting position.\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining a smooth and controlled movement pattern throughout the exercise.",
