  "name": "Lat Pull Down (Straight Back)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Machine**: Start by adjusting the seat and thigh pads of the lat pull-down machine. Sit down and make sure your thighs are secure under the pads, which will help you stay in position during the exercise.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar**: Stand up slightly to grab the bar with a wide grip. Your palms should be facing forward (pronated grip). The width of your grip can vary, but a common width is to have your hands placed wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. **Sit Down and Position Yourself**: Once you have a firm grip on the bar, sit down on the seat and secure your thighs under the pads. Keep your back straight and your core engaged. Lean back slightly but maintain an upright posture throughout the movement.\n\n4. **Start the Pull**: Begin the exercise by pulling the bar down towards your chest. Aim to bring the bar to your upper chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull. Maintain a controlled and steady motion throughout, avoiding jerky movements.\n\n5. **Keep Your Back Straight**: It is crucial to keep your back straight and your torso still. Do not lean back or swing your body to pull the weight.\n\n6. **Return to Starting Position**: Slowly extend your arms and return the bar to the starting position. Ensure that you maintain control during this part of the movement.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining good form with each pull. Typically, aim for 8-12 reps for strength training.",
