  "name": "Lat Pull Down (Straight Back)",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Seat and Weights**: Start by adjusting the knee pad on the lat pulldown machine so that it fits snugly against your thighs. This will keep your body stable as you perform the exercise. Select a weight that is appropriate for your fitness level.\n\n2. **Grip the Bar**: Stand up to reach and grab the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you), slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Sit back down, making sure your thighs are secured under the knee pads.\n\n3. **Position Your Body**: Sit upright with your back straight and chest up. Your feet should be flat on the floor, and your core should be braced. Lean back slightly only if necessary, but keep your torso as vertical as possible throughout the exercise.\n\n4. **Begin the Pull Down**: Exhale and pull the bar down towards your chest by contracting your lat muscles. Keep your elbows pointed straight down and focus on pulling with your back, not your arms. The bar should come to your upper chest or just below your chin. Avoid using momentum to pull the weight down.\n\n5. **Pause and Squeeze**: At the bottom of the movement, pause briefly and squeeze your shoulder blades together.\n\n6. **Return to Starting Position**: Inhale as you slowly extend your arms and allow the bar to rise back to the starting position, maintaining control and keeping tension in your lats. Keep your core engaged to prevent your torso from moving.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Perform 8-12 repetitions for 2-3 sets, depending on your fitness goals and training level.",
