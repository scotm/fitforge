  "name": "Left Neck Stretch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand or sit comfortably with your back straight and shoulders relaxed. \n\n2. Slowly turn your head to face the right side. This should be a gentle movement; do not force the turn beyond what is comfortable.\n\n3. Once your head is turned to the right, slowly tilt your right ear towards your right shoulder. You should feel a stretch along the left side of your neckâ€”specifically, the left sternocleidomastoid muscle.\n\n4. To increase the stretch, you may gently place your right hand on top of your head and apply slight pressure, pulling your head further towards your right shoulder. Ensure this is done gently to avoid any discomfort or pain.\n\n5. Keep your left shoulder relaxed, do not let it rise as you stretch.\n\n6. Hold this position for 20 to 30 seconds, breathing deeply and slowly.\n\n7. To release, slowly bring your head back up to the neutral position.\n\n8. Repeat the stretch 2 to 3 times to fully elongate the muscles on the left side of your neck.",
