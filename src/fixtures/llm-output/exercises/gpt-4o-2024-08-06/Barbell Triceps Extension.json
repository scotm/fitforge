  "name": "Barbell Triceps Extension",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**: Sit on a bench with back support, or stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart for stability. Grip a barbell with both hands, using a narrow overhand grip, and raise it overhead with your elbows fully extended. This is your starting position. The bar should be in line with your shoulders.\n2. **Descending Phase**: Keeping your upper arms stationary, lower the barbell in a controlled manner by bending at the elbows. Lower the bar until it is just above the back of your head. Avoid any excessive movement of the upper arms to minimize shoulder involvement.\n3. **Stretching the Triceps**: At the bottom of the movement, you should feel a stretch in your triceps. Ensure that your elbows are pointing upwards and remain close to your head.\n4. **Ascending Phase**: Reverse the movement direction by extending your elbows and raising the barbell back to the starting position. Ensure the movement is controlled to maintain continuous tension in the triceps.\n5. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the barbell and exhale as you press it back up to the starting position.\n6. **Repetitions**: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, usually ranging from 8 to 12.\n\n### Tips:\n- Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to maintain proper form and stability.\n- It might be helpful to have a spotter assist when performing this exercise, especially if using heavier weights to prevent injury.",
