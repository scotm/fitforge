  "how_to_perform": "1. **Stand or Sit in a Comfortable Position:** Begin by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart or sitting upright in a chair. Ensure your back is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.\n\n2. **Start with a Neutral Position:** Your head should be upright, and your gaze should be forward to start. Keep your chin slightly tucked to lengthen the back of your neck.\n\n3. **Slowly Tilt Your Head to the Right:** Gently tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear closer to your shoulder. Keep your shoulders relaxed and avoid lifting them.\n\n4. **Begin the Circle from Right to Forward:** Gently and slowly roll your head forward, so your chin moves towards your chest.\n\n5. **Complete the Forward Motion:** Continue to roll your head forward and towards the left side, bringing your left ear near your left shoulder.\n\n6. **Circle Backward:** From the left side, gently tilt your head backward, so your chin lifts and your eyes gaze toward the ceiling.\n\n7. **Complete the Circle to the Right:** Continue circling to bring your head back to the starting position, making a full circle.\n\n8. **Repeat:** Perform the circle 5-10 times in the clockwise direction. Move slowly and with control, being mindful of your neck's range of motion.\n\n9. **Focus on Smooth Movement:** Ensure each movement is smooth and even throughout the circle. Do not rush, and avoid jerky movements.\n\n10. **Breathe:** Inhale and exhale naturally as you perform the circle, maintaining a calm and relaxed state.\n\n11. **Switch Directions (optional):** For balance, you can also perform counter-clockwise neck circles after completing the clockwise set.",
