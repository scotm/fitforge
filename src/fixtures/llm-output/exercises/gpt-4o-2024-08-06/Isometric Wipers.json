  "name": "Isometric Wipers",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by lying flat on your back on an exercise mat. Extend your arms out to your sides in a T-shape with your palms facing down. This will help with stabilization.\n\n2. Raise both of your legs up towards the ceiling, keeping them straight. Your legs should form a 90-degree angle with your torso.\n\n3. Engage your core muscles by drawing your navel towards your spine and pressing your lower back into the floor. This will prevent any arching of the back and ensure that the core is engaged throughout the exercise.\n\n4. Slowly lower your legs to one side, keeping them as straight as possible. Go as far as you can while maintaining control and keeping your opposite shoulder firmly planted on the ground. You should aim for your legs to be parallel to the floor but only go as far as your flexibility and core strength allow.\n\n5. Hold the position at the lowest point for a moment, feeling the engagement in your obliques (side abs) as well as the stabilizing muscles of the inner and outer thighs.\n\n6. Using your core strength, bring your legs back to the starting position pointing straight up towards the ceiling while maintaining a tight core.\n\n7. Without pausing at the top, smoothly lower your legs to the opposite side in a controlled manner, again keeping your opposite shoulder down and ensuring that your core remains engaged.\n\n8. Hold briefly at this side and then return your legs back to the center once more.\n\n9. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring that your movements are smooth and controlled throughout and that you're maintaining proper form.",
