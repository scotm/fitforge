  "name": "One-Legged Calf Raises",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand on one foot with the ball of your foot on the edge of a step or platform, allowing your heel to hang off the back. You can hold onto a wall, railing, or any stable surface for balance. Alternatively, if balance allows, you can perform it without holding onto anything.\n\n2. Begin with your heel slightly lower than the level of the step to stretch your calf muscle. This is your starting position.\n\n3. Keeping your balance, press through the ball of your foot to raise your heel as high as possible, engaging your calf muscle. Ensure that your body is kept upright and stable throughout the movement.\n\n4. Hold the top position for a moment, fully contracting the calf muscle.\n\n5. Slowly lower your heel back down below the level of the step to the starting position, feeling a stretch in the calf.\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\n7. Switch to the other foot and repeat the exercise to ensure both calves are trained equally.",
