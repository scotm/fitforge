  "name": "Renegade Row",
  "how_to_perform": "**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart.\n* Place your hands on the floor directly under your shoulders, with your arms straight and your fingers facing forward.\n* Engage your core muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine.\n\n2. From this position, lift one hand off the ground and hold it in front of you at shoulder height.\n* Your arm should be fully extended, with a slight bend in the elbow if needed for control.\n\n3. Bend your knees slightly to lower your body towards the ground without losing the plank position.\n* Keep your weight centered over your hands and avoid letting your hips sag.\n\n4. While keeping one hand on the ground, lean forward away from the lifted hand, extending it fully behind you while keeping control of your core and maintaining a straight line from head to heels.\n* Focus on using your back muscles to pull your elbow down towards your spine, rather than just lifting your shoulder or arm.\n\n5. Pull the dumbbell towards you, then release back to the start position.\n\n6. Repeat with the opposite hand.",
