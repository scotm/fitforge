  "name": "Incline Plank With Alternate Floor Touch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by positioning yourself in front of a sturdy platform or exercise bench that is around mid-shin to knee height. Make sure the surface is stable.\n\n2. Place your hands on the platform or bench, shoulder-width apart. Your fingers should be pointing forward.\n\n3. Walk your feet backward until your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. This is the starting position. Ensure your body is supported through your arms and toes, engaging your core muscles to keep your hips from sagging.\n\n4. Once you are stable in the incline plank position, lift your right hand off the bench and reach down to touch the floor beside your left arm. Keep your torso as stable as possible, using your core to minimize rotation.\n\n5. Return your right hand back to the bench to resume the starting plank position.\n\n6. Repeat the same motion with your left hand, lifting it off the bench and reaching down to touch the floor beside your right arm.\n\n7. Alternate this movement between your right and left hands while maintaining a steady and controlled motion throughout.\n\n8. Continue alternating touches for the desired number of repetitions or duration. Maintain proper form, keeping your core engaged and your body in a straight line at all times.",
