  "name": "Incline Plank With Alternate Floor Touch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start in a High Plank Position**: Begin by assuming a standard high plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels. Keep your feet hip-width apart, and engage your core muscles to maintain this alignment.\n\n2. **Elevate Your Feet**: Place your feet on an incline surface such as a bench, step, or sturdy box. Ensure that the surface is stable enough to support your weight safely.\n\n3. **Initiate the Movement**: Lift your right hand slowly off the ground and extend it towards your left side under your body to touch the floor. Keep your core engaged to avoid sagging or lifting your hips. Itâ€™s crucial to maintain balance through your legs and supporting arm.\n\n4. **Return to Plank Position**: Bring your right hand back to the starting position, placing it firmly on the ground.\n\n5. **Repeat on the Opposite Side**: Lift your left hand off the ground and extend it towards your right side under your body to touch the floor. Once again, maintain strong core engagement and ensure your hips remain stable.\n\n6. **Continue Alternating**: Repeat the alternate floor touch movement for your desired number of repetitions or duration.",
