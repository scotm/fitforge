  "name": "Pallof Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Position yourself next to a cable machine or resistance band anchored to a wall. Stand perpendicular to the machine/anchor point, about shoulder-width apart, so that the cable or band is directly at your side.\n\n2. **Grip and Stance:** Grasp the handle with both hands, keeping your hands centered at your chest. Step away from the machine to create tension on the cable or band. Your feet should be about shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and core engaged. The cable or band should be parallel to the ground, and your elbows should be bent.\n\n3. **Starting Position:** Keep your chest up and your shoulders relaxed. Stand tall with good posture, ensuring that your neck is in a neutral position.\n\n4. **Press Out:** Slowly and with control, press your hands out in front of you, extending your arms fully. Do this while resisting the lateral pull of the cable or band, keeping your hands centered along your midline.\n\n5. **Pause:** Once your arms are fully extended, pause for a moment. Focus on maintaining tension in your core and preventing your body from twisting.\n\n6. **Return:** Slowly bring your hands back to the starting position at your chest. Keep control over the movement and maintain tension in your core throughout.\n\n7. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining your stance and posture. Switch sides to work the opposite side of your body.",
