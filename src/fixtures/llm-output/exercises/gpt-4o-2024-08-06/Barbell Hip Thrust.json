  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Bench and Barbell:** Place a barbell on the floor parallel to a bench. Sit on the floor with your upper back against the bench. Roll the barbell so that it is over your legs.\n2. **Position Yourself:** Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor, hips-width apart. Roll the barbell over your hips, just below the pelvic bone. To protect your hips, you can use a pad or towel around the barbell.\n3. **Brace Your Core:** Engage your core muscles and keep your chin tucked down toward your chest. Your gaze should be forward throughout the entire movement.\n4. **Lift Off the Floor:** Drive through your heels to lift your hips off the floor, maintaining pressure and tension through your glutes. The bench should support your upper back when fully raised.\n5. **Thrust and Hold:** Continue to thrust your hips upward until your knees are bent at a 90-degree angle, and your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Squeeze your glutes tightly at the top of the movement for maximum contraction.\n6. **Lower with Control:** Slowly lower your hips back down toward the floor without letting the barbell hit the ground, maintaining tension in your glutes.\n7. **Repeat:** Perform the desired number of repetitions, ensuring your movements are controlled and your glutes remain engaged throughout the exercise.",
