  "how_to_perform": "1. **Set Up the Decline Bench**: Position a decline bench beneath a barbell rack. Adjust the angle if it's adjustable, typically between 15-30 degrees decline.\n\n2. **Load the Barbell**: Add the desired amount of weight to the barbell, ensuring the weight is equally distributed on both sides. Secure the plates with collars to prevent sliding.\n\n3. **Get into Position**: Sit at the high end of the decline bench, then carefully lower yourself down. Hook your feet under the foot holds at the lower end of the bench for stability.\n\n4. **Grip the Barbell**: Reach up to grasp the barbell with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Make sure your palms are facing forward and your thumbs are wrapped around the bar for safety.\n\n5. **Unrack the Barbell**: Lift the barbell off the rack by straightening your arms. Move it into a position directly above your chest with your elbows locked out.\n\n6. **Lower the Barbell**: Slowly bend your elbows to lower the bar in a controlled manner toward the bottom of your chest. Your elbows should remain at a roughly 45-degree angle from your body.\n\n7. **Press the Barbell Back Up**: Once the barbell reaches just above your chest, press it back upward by straightening your arms until they are fully extended.\n\n8. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, ensuring control and proper form throughout each rep.\n\n9. **Rack the Barbell**: When finished, carefully guide the barbell back to the rack by slightly leaning forward and engaging the upper body muscles to place it securely onto the rack hooks.",
