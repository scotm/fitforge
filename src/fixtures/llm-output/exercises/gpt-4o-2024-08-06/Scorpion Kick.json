  "name": "Scorpion Kick",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**: \n   - Lie on your stomach with your arms extended overhead and legs straight.\n   - Engage your core muscles to maintain control throughout the exercise.\n\n2. **Engaging the Core**:\n   - Begin by tensing your abdominal muscles, engaging your transverse abdominis, and drawing your belly button towards your spine.\n\n3. **Lifting from Pelvis**:\n   - From this engaged position, slowly lift your legs off the ground from your pelvis.\n   - Keep your lower back pressed into the floor to avoid unnecessary strain, maintaining a slight arch in your lower back.\n\n4. **Flexing Foot and Ankle**:\n   - Flex the foot of one leg and raise it towards the ceiling while allowing the other leg to remain straight. Aim for the straight leg to be about 1 inch above ground as you lift the first leg.\n   - Keep the knee straight, engage your lower back muscles, and use control to lift.\n\n5. **Crown Kick**:\n   - Continue lifting with control until you reach a point where the raising foot is almost touching the ceiling directly above your head, performing a 'crown kick'.\n   - Maintain proper form by keeping your body solid and avoiding bouncing movements, using strength in your core muscles to complete the movement.\n\n6. **Return to Starting Position**:\n   - Lower the raised leg down towards the ground while maintaining control and gradually returning it into position against the initial starting point.\n   - This sequence should be performed on both sides of the body for balance, alternating legs as you repeat.\n\n7. **Repeat**:\n   - Perform for recommended repetition counts (8-12 repetitions per side), focusing on proper form to target and engage your abdominal muscles effectively throughout each exercise repetition.",
