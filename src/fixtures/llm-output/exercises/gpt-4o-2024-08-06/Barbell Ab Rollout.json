Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the barbell, gripping it firmly.\n\n3. **Starting Position**: Begin in a kneeling position, with your torso upright and hands gripping the bar tightly. Ensure your core is engaged and your back is straight.\n\n4. **Roll Forward**: Slowly and in a controlled manner, roll the barbell forward by extending your arms, lowering your torso towards the floor. Keep your abs tight to maintain control over the movement. Your body should form a straight line from your hips to your head.\n\n5. **Go As Far As Comfortable**: Roll as far as you can go without arching your back or feeling discomfort in your lower back. Your goal is to keep your body aligned and your core engaged.\n\n6. **Return to Start**: Once you have reached your comfortable limit, tighten your core and roll the bar back toward your knees, returning to the starting position.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Perform the desired number of repetitions, maintaining good form throughout the exercise.",
