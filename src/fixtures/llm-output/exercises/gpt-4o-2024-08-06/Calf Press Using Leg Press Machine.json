  "name": "Calf Press Using Leg Press Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Adjust the Leg Press Machine**: Start by setting the backrest and seat of the leg press machine to your desired position. You want to be comfortably seated with your back supported and your legs at a slight angle to prevent overextension.\n\n2. **Position Your Feet**: Sit on the leg press machine and place your feet at the lower end of the platform, shoulder-width apart. Your heels should be slightly off the edge, so when you push the platform with your toes, your heels are free to dip.\n\n3. **Select the Appropriate Weight**: Set a manageable weight to begin with. It's important to maintain control and use proper form. Too much weight can compromise your form and lead to injury.\n\n4. **Pressing Movement**: With your toes and the balls of your feet planted on the platform, extend your legs to press the platform away using your calves. Make sure your knees are slightly bent to prevent locking them out completely.\n\n5. **Full Range of Motion**: Once your legs are extended, lower the platform by flexing your ankles, allowing your heels to drop below the plane of your toes. This ensures a full stretch of your calf muscles.\n\n6. **Return to Start Position**: Press the platform back upwards by extending your ankles, raising your heels back to the starting position. Pause briefly at the top to maximize contraction.\n\n7. **Perform Repetitions**: Repeat the pressing and lowering movement for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining a steady and controlled pace throughout.\n\n8. **Close Routine Safely**: Once you've completed your set, securely re-rack the weight and return the machine to its starting setting.",
