  "name": "Hindu Squats",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position:** Stand upright with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be relaxed and hanging down at your sides, with an open stance and your palms facing back.\n\n2. **Begin the Movement:** As you start to lower yourself into the squat, simultaneously begin a sweeping arm movement. Start by raising your arms in front of you as you descend. Your movement should be fluid and smooth.\n\n3. **Lowering the Body:** As you squat down, bend your knees and hips to lower your torso. Try to keep your back as straight as possible, engaging your core to maintain balance. Your knees should track over your toes and your heels should remain in contact with the floor.\n\n4. **Arm Positioning:** As your torso comes down, your arms should continue to move forward and rise. At the lowest point of the squat, your hands should be at shoulder height and parallel to the floor.\n\n5. **Breathing:** Inhale as you descend into the squat. Breathe deeply to keep oxygen flowing and to stabilize your body.\n\n6. **Bottom Position:** At the bottom of the squat, try to touch your buttocks to your calves, if flexibility allows. Ensure that your feet remain flat and your knees donâ€™t collapse inwards.\n\n7. **Rising Up:** To return to the starting position, exhale and push through your heels to stand back up. As you rise, bring your arms downward again in a sweeping arc, so they return to your sides.\n\n8. **Final Position:** Finish in the starting standing position with your arms naturally resting at your sides, ready to start the next repetition. Maintain fluidity in your movements throughout the exercise.",
