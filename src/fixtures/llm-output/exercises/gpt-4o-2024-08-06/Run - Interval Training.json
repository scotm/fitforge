  "name": "Run - Interval Training",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin with a light warm-up jog or brisk walk for 5-10 minutes to increase your heart rate gently and prepare your muscles for the workout.\\n2. Choose a suitable path or track with ample space and minimal obstacles.\\n3. Start the first interval by running at a high intensity, typically around 80-90% of your maximum effort, for a short duration, such as 30 seconds to 1 minute. Focus on maintaining proper form by keeping your back straight, eyes forward, and using a natural arm swing.\\n4. After the high-intensity interval, reduce your speed to a light jog or brisk walk to recover. This recovery period should be about twice the length of your high-intensity interval, generally around 1-2 minutes.\\n5. Repeat this cycle of high-intensity running followed by a lower-intensity recovery several times, typically for a total of 15 to 30 minutes, depending on your fitness level and goals.\\n6. Cool down with a gentle walk or light jog for 5-10 minutes to gradually lower your heart rate and aid in recovery.\\n7. Finish with stretching exercises focusing on the calves, hamstrings, quads, and hip flexors to improve flexibility and reduce muscle stiffness.",
