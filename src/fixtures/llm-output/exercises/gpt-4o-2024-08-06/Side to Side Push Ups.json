  "name": "Side to Side Push Ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Get into Position**: Start by placing your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground, keeping them directly under your shoulders.\n\n2. **Initial Alignment**:\n   - Ensure that your feet are hip-width apart.\n   - Keep your core engaged and straighten your entire body from head to heels.\n\n3. **Movement Direction**:\n   - Lower yourself down into a push-up position with your hands firmly on the ground, but do not touch your toes or rest your nose on the ground yet.\n\n4. **Side Movement**: \n   - Begin moving one arm laterally (to the side until it almost reaches the starting point, keeping in mind that you won't actually return to the original hand position. For the purpose of this exercise, moving out should be the goal.\n  \n5. **Return and Swap Positions**:\n   - Push back up to the starting position using the arm just used for movement (it will still be holding almost full extension). Hold there briefly before switching to the second starting point for the alternate push-up arm.\n\n6. **Second Side Movement**: \n   - Now repeat steps 3 and 4 with your opposite side, starting from a similar lowered position but moving this time in reverse, returning towards your original starting hand position after completing the exercise.\n\n7. **Ending**: \n   - Ensure that your movements are controlled throughout each half of the exercise, minimizing strain on joints by keeping them slightly bent when fully extended.\n  \n8. **Alternative Final Option**:\n   - Consider adding weight to an equivalent push-up variation, but ensure you're focusing on quality movements since improper posture and control could offset benefits.",
