  "name": "Hip Raise, Lying",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie flat on your back on a comfortable surface, such as a yoga mat. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the floor about hip-width apart. Your arms should be resting at your sides with your palms facing down.\n\n2. Ensure that your feet are positioned comfortably close to your glutes so that when you lift, there is a natural movement pattern.\n\n3. Engage your core by pulling your belly button in towards your spine. This helps to stabilize your pelvis and prevent overextending your back.\n\n4. Begin the movement by pressing through your heels. Lift your hips towards the ceiling while keeping your upper back on the ground. Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to your knees at the top of the movement.\n\n5. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the movement and hold for a moment.\n\n6. Slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on controlled lifting and lowering, and keeping your core tight and engaged at all times.",
