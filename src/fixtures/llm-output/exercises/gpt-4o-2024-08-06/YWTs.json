  "name": "YWTs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Assume the Plank Position**: \n   - Start by getting on your hands and knees (all fours). \n   - Place your hands directly under your shoulders, with your arms slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n   - Engage your core muscles to support your body in a straight line from head to heels. This is the starting position.\n\n2. **Leg Lift**: \n   - From the plank position, lift one leg off the ground and hold it at an 8-10 inch height above the floor (about hip-level).\n   - Keep your knee straight and hold for about 1-3 seconds.\n\n3. **Lowering**: \n   - Start a slow count of 2 to lower that lifted leg back down to a plank position.\n   - Lower without touching or landing.\n\n4. **Second Leg Lift**: \n   - Next, lift the second leg off the floor as in step 2.\n   - Focus on engaging your core muscles for stability throughout the movement.\n\n5. **Alternate Legs**: \n   - Continue alternating legs with slow counts between each repetition.\n   - As you lower one leg, focus on not touching the ground or letting the other stay airborne.\n\n6. **Breathing and Form**: \n   - Remember to breathe normally while performing this exercise.\n   - Keep your shoulders down away from your ears as in a plank position. Engage that core tightly for better form control throughout the movement.",
