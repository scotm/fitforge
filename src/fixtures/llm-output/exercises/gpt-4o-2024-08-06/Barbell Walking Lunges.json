  "name": "Barbell Walking Lunges",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup:** Begin by loading a barbell with an appropriate weight. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart. Position the barbell on your upper back, resting on the trapezius muscles, and grip the bar with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. **Starting Position:** Stand with your feet together and your chest up. Tighten your core and position your gaze directly forward.\n\n3. **Step Forward:** Take a controlled step forward with your right foot, landing heel first.\n\n4. **Lower Down:** As your front foot connects with the floor, lower your hips towards the ground by bending both knees to approximately 90 degrees. Your right knee should be above your right ankle, and your left knee should hover just above the ground. Ensure your front knee stays aligned with your foot and does not extend past your toes.\n\n5. **Drive Up:** Push through your right heel and extend both knees to raise your body back up. Bring your left foot forward to meet your right, returning to a standing position.\n\n6. **Alternate Legs:** Step forward with your left leg next, and repeat the lunge movement.\n\n7. **Repeat:** Continue alternating legs with each lunge, moving forward in a walking motion over the desired distance or repetitions.\n\n8. **Focus on Form:** Keep your back straight and core engaged throughout the exercise to maintain stability and balance.",
