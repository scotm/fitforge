  "name": "Crunches",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie down on your back on a mat or flat surface. Bend your knees to about a 90-degree angle, keeping your feet flat on the ground about hip-width apart. Place your hands behind your head with your elbows bent outward, or you can cross them over your chest for more challenge.\n\n2. Engage your core by drawing your navel in towards your spine. Keep your lower back pressed gently into the ground to protect your spine.\n\n3. Exhale and lift your head, shoulders, and chest off the ground by contracting your abdominal muscles. Lift until your upper back is off the floor, and hold at the top for a brief second.\n\n4. Inhale and slowly lower your torso back down to the starting position, maintaining tension in the core throughout the movement.\n\n5. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring each crunch is controlled and fully engages your abdominal muscles.",
