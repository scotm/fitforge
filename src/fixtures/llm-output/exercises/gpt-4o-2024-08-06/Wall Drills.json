  "how_to_perform": "1. **Starting Position**:\n   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands on a wall at shoulder height.\n   - Ensure your body is in a straight line from head to heels, avoiding any lean or tilt.\n\n2. **Initial Movement**:\n   - Slowly slide one foot backward while keeping the other foot forward, without moving your hands from the wall.\n   - Repeat this motion with different feet, focusing on keeping your posture straight during each movement.\n\n3. **Depth Adjustment**:\n   - To vary the difficulty level, adjust the depth of your back foot's extension. Going for a smaller range of motion will make the exercise easier, while reaching further back will increase its intensity.\n   - Focus on maintaining the correct form throughout the exercise to avoid any unnecessary stress or discomfort.\n\n4. **Repeat**:\n   - Perform this movement for an appropriate number of repetitions and both feet, trying to maintain the original level of engagement in the core muscles through controlled breathing.",
