  "how_to_perform": "1. **Equipment Setup**: \n   - Choose a pair of dumbbells with an appropriate weight for your fitness level.\n\n2. **Starting Position**: \n   - Sit or stand with back support and hold one dumbbell in each hand. Place the dumbbells beside your thighs, palms facing forward (towards your thighs).\n\n3. **Initial Movement**:\n   - Without rotating your forearms, bend your wrists so that your hands curl upward. Focus on using only your wrist muscles for this exercise.\n\n4. **Curling Motion**:\n   - Continue curling the dumbbells with your wrists bent at an angle of about 15-20 degrees. Hold the contracted position briefly before releasing and returning to the starting point.\n\n5. **Repeat**: \n   - Perform the movement on one side (e.g., right hand) first, then switch sides. Alternatively, to make it more challenging, alternate arms with each repetition.\n\n6. **Final Reps**:\n   - For optimal results, do a certain number of repetitions and sets as specified,",
