  "name": "Incline Dumbbell Fly",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Start by adjusting an incline bench to an angle of about 30-45 degrees. Sit on the bench and pick up a dumbbell in each hand using a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Rest the dumbbells on your thighs.\n2. **Positioning**: Lean back onto the bench while simultaneously bringing the dumbbells up to your chest. Use your thighs to help push the weights up if needed.\n3. **Starting Position**: Once you are laying back on the bench, lift the dumbbells above your chest by extending your arms fully. Your palms should still be facing each other. Keep a slight bend in your elbows to reduce strain on your joints.\n4. **Execution**: Inhale deeply, and begin the movement by lowering the dumbbells in a wide arc out to your sides. Focus on keeping the movement smooth and controlled, maintaining the slight bend in your elbows. Lower the weights until your arms are about parallel to the ground or you feel a stretch in your chest.\n5. **Contraction**: Exhale as you bring the dumbbells back up to the starting position by reversing the motion, squeezing your chest muscles at the top of the movement.\n6. **Completion**: Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n7. **Ending the Exercise**: To safely end the exercise, bring the dumbbells back to your chest, sit up using your core, and place the dumbbells back onto your thighs before setting them down on the ground.",
