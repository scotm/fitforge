  "name": "Sit-ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie on a flat surface, with your back supported by a mat or small cushion.\n\n2. Place your hands behind you for support and engage your core muscles to keep a stable lower back position.\n\n3. Elevate your legs slightly higher than the ground so they aren't touching. You can either lift them in the air or have someone hold them for support if needed. This will allow for greater isolation of abdominal muscles during contractions. Your lower back should rest comfortably on the floor or surface you're lying on, with a slight arch.\n\n4. Slowly elevate your shoulders off the ground toward your knees while keeping your hands and hips stable, so your elbows are at about 90-degree angles when in the top position. Engage your abdominal muscles during contraction, to bring your upper back and chest areas towards your belly button (also known as 'curl up'). Breathe outwards, not in.\n\n5. Hold that position for a brief moment (count to one or two). Ensure you're able to return to the starting position slowly without touching anything besides your feet on the ground, making sure your elbows stay straight. When lowering down, do so smoothly and carefully, breathing back in before repeating again if desired.",
