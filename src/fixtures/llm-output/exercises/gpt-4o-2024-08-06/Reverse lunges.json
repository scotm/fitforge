  "how_to_perform": "### **Step-by-Step Instructions** \n\n1. Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, facing away from the back of a chair or a stable surface.\n2. Step one foot backward, keeping it straight and maintaining pressure on the heel that remains in front. Your stance should resemble a wide-legged stance. \n3. Keeping your torso upright, lower the body down towards the back leg until both knees are bent at around 90-100°. Make sure to not let your back knee touch or nearly touch the ground – keep a slight bend.\n4. Ensure your front thigh stays parallel to the floor whilst keeping your weight primarily on the heel of that limb, maintaining balance with a slightly larger bend in the front leg.\nThe **how-to** step might necessitate an additional consideration: You can adjust your backspace based on personal space, using a door as support if required. Make sure you place the feet at comfortable distances allowing free movement while executing any activity.",
