  "name": "Romanian Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Initial Position**: \n   - Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n   - Keep your back straight and engage your core, feeling a steady contraction in the muscles across your lower back.\n\n2. **Starting Grip**: \n   - Hold a barbell or dumbbells with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you).\n   - The weight should rest on top of your feet but not touching them.\n\n3. **Initial Movement**:\n   - Keeping your heels in contact with the ground, hinging at the hips while keeping the back straight is key to proper form.\n   - Lean forward slowly, allowing gravity to stretch your body downward as you reach for the desired weight distribution on the floor.\n   - Focus on moving from a standing position through an arc until your arms are fully extended. \n\n4. **Full Extension**:\n   - You should be lying flat and extended with your entire spine straight. Be slow in achieving full extension, focusing strongly on maintaining this form throughout.\n\n5. **Contract to Return**: \n   - With control, slowly contract your muscles to return the weight to its upright position. This process should not feel overly difficult if performed correctly.\n   \n6. **Repeat**:\n   Focus on precision as you repeat for your desired repetitions.",
