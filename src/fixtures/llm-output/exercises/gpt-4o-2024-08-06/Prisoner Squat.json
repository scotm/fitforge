  "name": "Prisoner Squat",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand upright with your feet shoulder-width apart.  \n2. Raise your arms and clasp your hands behind your head, keeping your elbows pointed out to the sides. This position adds a level of difficulty by engaging your upper back as you work to maintain an open chest position.  \n3. Sit back and down into a squat, as if you are going to sit in a chair, making sure to keep your elbows back and your chest up to avoid rounding your back.  \n4. Lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the floor or as low as you can comfortably go, ensuring your knees do not go past your toes.  \n5. Press through your heels to return to a standing position.  \n6. Repeat the squat for the desired number of repetitions.",
