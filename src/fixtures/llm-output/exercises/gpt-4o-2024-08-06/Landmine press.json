  "name": "Landmine Press",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup the Equipment**: Position the landmine in a secure corner or landmine holder to prevent it from moving. Load the desired weight onto the free end of the barbell. Ensure the barbell is anchored firmly to prevent slipping during the exercise.\n2. **Get into Position**: Stand facing the landmine with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Grasp the end of the barbell with one hand, holding it at shoulder height. Your palm should be facing towards you, and the elbow should be close to your body.\n3. **Stance and Grip**: Assume a staggered stance with one foot slightly in front of the other for better balance and core engagement. Use an overhand grip with your thumb wrapped around the barbell.\n4. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core muscles to provide stability to your torso. Keep your back straight and your shoulders pulled back and down.\n5. **Press the Barbell**: Push the barbell upward by extending your arm. Press the barbell until your arm is fully extended, keeping a slight bend in the elbow to keep the tension on the muscles.\n6. **Lockout**: At the top of the movement, pause briefly, making sure not to lock out completely at the elbow to maintain muscle tension.\n7. **Controlled Descent**: Slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position at shoulder height in a controlled manner.\n8. **Switch Sides**: After completing the set reps on one side, switch to the other hand and perform the exercise for an equal number of repetitions to maintain balance and symmetry.\n9. **Breathing**: Exhale as you press the barbell up and inhale as you return it to the starting position. Always maintain controlled breathing throughout the movement.",
