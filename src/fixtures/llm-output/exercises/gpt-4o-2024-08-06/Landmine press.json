  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup the Landmine Unit**: Insert one end of a barbell into the landmine holder or a corner. The other end is free to move. Use weight plates on the free end as needed to adjust difficulty.\n\n2. **Stance and Grip**: Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, facing the free end of the barbell. Hold the barbell with one hand, positioning it at shoulder height. Your palm should face inward to your body.\n\n3. **Engage Your Core**: Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your body. This helps in maintaining balance during the movement.\n\n4. **Press the Barbell**: Extend your elbow to press the barbell up and forward, aiming in a path slightly away from your body. Your arm should almost fully extend without locking the elbow.\n\n5. **Control the Descent**: Slowly bring the barbell back to the starting position, ensuring control and maintaining core stability throughout.\n\n6. **Breathing**: Inhale as you lower the weight, exhale as you press upward.\n\n7. **Repetitions and Switching Arms**: Repeat for the desired number of reps, then switch to the opposite arm. Aim for equal reps on each side to ensure balanced muscle development.",
