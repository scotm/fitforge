  "name": "Rowing Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Begin by sitting comfortably on the rowing machine seat and securing your feet in the foot straps, making sure they are snug but not too tight. Adjust the footrests if needed so that the strap crosses the ball of your foot.\\n2. Grasp the handle with both hands using an overhand grip, ensuring your hands are shoulder-width apart. Keep your grip relaxed to avoid unnecessary tension.\\n3. Start the movement by pushing off with your legs, and keep your arms straight as you slide back on the seat. Aim to engage your leg muscles primarily for this part of the stroke.\\n4. Once your legs are fully extended, lean back slightly, engaging your core, and then pull the handle towards your lower rib cage, bending at the elbows. Your back should remain straight throughout this movement.\\n5. Reverse the motion by extending your arms fully, leaning slightly forward from the hips, and bending your knees to slide the seat back towards the starting position. This marks one full stroke.\\n6. Maintain a consistent tempo and rhythm, focusing on using your legs, core, and arms in a sequential manner. Breathe naturally throughout the exercise.\\n7. Continue rowing for the desired amount of time or distance, adjusting speed and intensity based on your fitness goals.",
