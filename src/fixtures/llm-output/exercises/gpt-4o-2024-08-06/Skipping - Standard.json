  "name": "Skipping - Standard",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Proper Posture**: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, engaging your core for stability and proper form.\n\n2. **Jumping Motion**:\n   - Start moving one foot off the ground slightly (don't lift too high). The heel of the foot should be barely raised from the ground.\n   - Now rapidly swing your other leg back to meet the first foot. At this point, your legs are almost in line with each other, and you're getting ready for the next step.\n\n3. **Second Step**: \n   - Swing the first foot forward again but don't just throw it. Remember, the key is rapid but controlled movement.\n   - As the front foot lands, be prepared to quickly hop back with your rear foot, ensuring the heel barely touches the ground while keeping the toe up.\n\n4. **Continuation of Motion**:\n   - Each repetition should involve swift turnover from one leg to another (remembering to keep control and posture engaged) without a pause or break point during execution.\n   \n5. Repeat the jump motion for the desired number of repetitions.",
