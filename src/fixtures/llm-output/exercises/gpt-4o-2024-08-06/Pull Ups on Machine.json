  "name": "Pull Ups on Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Adjust the weight on the machine. This will be the counterbalance weight that helps you lift your own body weight. Choose a weight that allows you to complete 8-12 repetitions with good form.\\n\\n2. Stand on the step of the assisted pull-up machine and hold the pull-up bars with a grip slightly wider than shoulder-width. Your palms should be facing forward (overhand grip).\\n\\n3. Once you have a secure grip, step onto the platform and kneel on the padded knee rest. Your body should be stable, and you should feel the weight balancing your body.\\n\\n4. Fully extend your arms so your body is in a hanging position, with your knees resting on the support pad.\\n\\n5. Engage your core and pull yourself up by bending your elbows and pulling them towards your sides. Keep your chest open and shoulders down as you lift your body upwards.\\n\\n6. Pull up until your chin just clears the bar. Be sure to keep your movements controlled, avoiding swinging or jerking motions.\\n\\n7. Slowly lower yourself back to the starting position by extending your arms, allowing the counterbalance to assist in controlling the descent.\\n\\n8. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.\\n\\n9. Once you have completed your set, carefully step off the knee pad back onto the platform and release your grip.",
