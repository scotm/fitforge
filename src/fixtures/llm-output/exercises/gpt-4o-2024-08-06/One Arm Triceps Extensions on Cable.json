  "name": "One Arm Triceps Extensions on Cable",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by setting up a cable machine with a single handle attachment. Adjust the pulley to the top setting.\n\n2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and face the cable machine.\n\n3. Grab the handle with one hand (the hand you want to work first), using a neutral or overhand grip, and step a few feet back from the machine. Your arm should be bent at the elbow and raised above your head.\n\n4. Keep your elbow close to your head, with your upper arm stable and perpendicular to the ground. Your starting position will have your tricep bent with the handle directly behind your head or slightly off to the side.\n\n5. Engage your core, and while keeping your upper arm stationary, extend your arm, pushing the handle up and forward until your arm is fully extended. Exhale as you perform this movement.\n\n6. Pause briefly at the top of the movement, where your arm is fully extended, and squeeze your tricep muscle.\n\n7. Slowly return the handle back to the starting position by bending your elbow, inhaling as you perform this movement. Your forearm should come back behind your head.\n\n8. Repeat the desired number of repetitions with this arm.\n\n9. Once you complete the set, switch to the other arm and repeat the exercise.",
