  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by sitting in a sturdy chair with your back straight and your feet flat on the ground.\n\n2. Hold a rowing handle or similar device firmly with both hands, with your palms facing towards your body.\n\n3. Keeping your arms straight, lean forward slightly to stretch your chest muscles.\n\n4. Engage your core and maintain good posture throughout the exercise.\n\n5. Pull the handle towards your chest by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body.\n\n6. Focus on using your back muscles (latissimus dorsi) to draw the handle toward your body, rather than relying solely on arm strength.\n\n7. As you return to the starting position, keep control of the movement and take a brief moment to rest before repeating the exercise.\n",
