  "name": "Barbell Hip Thrust",
  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the ground, directly under your hips. Ensure that your back is pressed firmly into the floor.\n\n2. Place a barbell across your hips, just above your pubic bone. Grip the bar with both hands, one hand facing upwards towards the ceiling, while keeping the other hand down towards your body, keeping in mind the exact position to be determined based on personal preference and training protocol variations.\n\n3. Engage your core muscles by pulling your belly button towards your lower spine as you squeeze the abdominal wall tightly while also contracting your gluteus maximus.\n\n4. Push your hips upwards against the barbell until both knees are forming right angles or at least are straight, pushing them up high without actually lifting your back off the ground. Ensure that no strain is felt from lower back but rather maintain a consistent firmness in position so as to not allow any instability due to hip thrusting, with an emphasis on squeezing those glutes like never before!\n\n5. Hold the top position momentarily (about 2 seconds), maintaining this state during which time feel for contraction deep within your pelvic region signifying optimal activation throughout gluteus major and minor muscle groups simultaneously.\n\n6. Gradually descend back down into starting position without losing control of movement but instead taking care to slowly release all tensed muscles as one returns to original position at beginning once full repetition was performed successfully.",
  "short_summary": "The barbell hip thrust is a strength training exercise targeting the glutes specifically, making it an effective way to develop and tone this muscle group efficiently.",
