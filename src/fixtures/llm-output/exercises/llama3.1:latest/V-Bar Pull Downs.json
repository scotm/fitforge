  "name": "V-Bar Pull Downs",
  "category": "Back",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Grasp the V-bar attachment with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.\n2. Sit at the end of a lat pulldown machine with your knees securely under the knee pad and feet flat on the floor.\n\n3. Pull the bar down towards your ribcage by squeezing your back muscles. Focus on using the lats to pull the weight down rather than just your arms.\n4. Avoid swinging or jerking the weight, as this can compromise proper form and put a strain on your joints.\n5. When you've fully contracted your back muscles and pulled the bar to your chest, pause briefly before beginning your repetition.\n\n6. Slowly release the tension in your back muscles by extending your arms without letting the weight bounce or jerk.\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
