  "name": "Front Wood Chop",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by holding a weight or object (such as a medicine ball) with both hands, standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n2. The key to this exercise is generating power from your core and hips. \n3. Twist your torso to one side while keeping the weight close to your body, using a forceful chopping motion with your arms. Make sure your arms are straight and your elbows locked out when you twist.\n4. Keep your twisting motion controlled and smooth, avoiding any jerky movements that could put unnecessary stress on your joints.\n5. Hold for a brief moment at the peak of your movement before slowly releasing back to the starting position.\n6. Repeat the exercise on the other side by twisting your torso the opposite direction.",
