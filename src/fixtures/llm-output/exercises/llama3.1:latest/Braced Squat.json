  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell or dumbbells across your back so that both hands are on top of the weight.\n2. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine and your lower back into a neutral position.\n\n3. Keeping the dumbbells resting horizontally across your upper back, start to bend at the hips and knees, keeping your heels flat on the ground throughout the movement.\n\n4. As you descend, keep your chest maintained in an upright position and ensure that your mid-back (thoracic spine) remains arched rather than collapsing upwards or sagging downwards.\n\n5. Lower yourself down into a quarter squat depth while maintaining the bracing of the core to support both the lower back and overall form during the exercise.\n\n6. Hold for 1-2 seconds at the bottom, before pushing back up through the entire range of motion so your hips, knees, and ankles are fully extended again, ensuring that the barbell remains stable across your upper back.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, taking care to maintain proper form throughout.",
