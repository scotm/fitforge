  "name": "Chin-Up",
  "category": "Arms",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing under a sturdy bar with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands grasping the bar with your palms facing away from you.\n\n2. Engage your core muscles to maintain good posture and balance throughout the exercise.\n\n3. Slowly lift yourself up onto your toes, keeping your body straight and your knees slightly bent.\n\n4. As you lift yourself up, pull your chest forward and upwards towards the bar, keeping your elbows close to your body.\n\n5. Focus on engaging your upper back muscles (latissimus dorsi) to control the movement of your body as you pull yourself up.\n\n6. When you reach the top of the movement, pause for a brief moment to allow your muscles to contract fully.\n\n7. To perform a true chin-up, take note that you should be able to hang from the bar with your arms at a full lock (elbows almost touching your ears) without any help or assistance from your lower body.\n\n8. To descend, slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position while keeping control of your movement, again engaging your upper back muscles to maintain proper form.\n\n9. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
  "short_summary": "The chin-up is an upper body exercise that targets the muscles in the arms, back, and shoulders, requiring you to lift your entire body using only your arms and engage your core to maintain good posture.",
