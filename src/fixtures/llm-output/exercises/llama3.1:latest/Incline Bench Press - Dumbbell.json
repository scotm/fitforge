  "name": "Incline Bench Press - Dumbbell",
  "category": "Chest",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Adjust the incline bench to a comfortable angle, ideally between 15-45 degrees.\n\n2. Lie back on the bench and grip two dumbbells with an overhand grip. Your hands should be positioned shoulder-width apart, with your arms fully extended above you at a 90-degree angle. The dumbbells should rest on your thighs, close to your body.\n\n3. Pull your shoulders down and away from your ears to maintain proper posture and engage the correct muscles.\n\n4. Slowly lower one dumbbell (or alternate hands) downward by bending your elbows until it is hovering above your chest at a 90-degree angle or slightly below. Keep your elbows close to your hips and avoid lowering too far, which can lead to unnecessary strain on your joints.\n\n5. Pause briefly to ensure you're getting the most out of this movement.\n\n6. Perform one final contraction where you push the dumbbell upwards by straightening your arm as much as possible, then slowly return it to its starting position.\n\n7. Repeat with the other hand or alternate between hands for the desired number of repetitions.",
