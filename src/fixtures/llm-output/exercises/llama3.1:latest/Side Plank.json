  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying on your side with your feet aligned in front of you and resting on the ground.\n2. Place your forearms on the floor in front of your body, perpendicular to the way you are facing (your upper arms will be positioned perpendicularly outside your shoulders).\n3. Lift your hips off the ground, keeping your body straight from head to heels, forming a long line with minimal sagging or arching.\n4. Engage your core muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your back remains flat and your hips do not dip or rise throughout the movement. \n5. Keep your forearms firmly on the ground, supporting the weight of your upper body.\n6. If desired, you can hold a slight bend in your elbow joints, but be sure to keep them at a moderate angle without extending them completely behind you.\n7. Maintain this position for the specified time or set number of repetitions, breathing naturally and avoiding holding your breath or tensioning your muscles.\n8. Slowly lower yourself to the starting position by reversing steps 3 through 5. ",
