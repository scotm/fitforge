  "category": "Arms",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in a lunge position with your front foot forward and back foot backward, keeping both hands holding dumbbells at shoulder height with palms facing each other.\n\n\n2. Lower yourself by bending the front knee of your front leg until your back thigh becomes almost parallel to the ground, making sure not to arch your back or let your hips sag.\n\n\n3. While in this position, focus on pulling the dumbbells towards you as if pulling something upward, squeezing the muscles across the top and rear of your shoulders.\n\n\n4. Focus on maintaining proper form throughout the entire range of motion without letting momentum assist or sacrificing control to lift heavier weights than you would otherwise safely handle.\n\n\n5. Once you've reached the point where you've pulled as hard as possible, slowly lower yourself back down while keeping the dumbbells at shoulder height and focus on extending the elbow joint.\n\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions by alternating your front leg in a lunge position.",
