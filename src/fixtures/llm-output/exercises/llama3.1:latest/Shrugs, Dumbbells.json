Slowly release your shoulder muscles, making sure not to let them sag or drop while you're coming back down.\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.\n\nNote: It's also essential to engage your core throughout this exercise, helping maintain proper posture and minimizing strain on your lower back.",
