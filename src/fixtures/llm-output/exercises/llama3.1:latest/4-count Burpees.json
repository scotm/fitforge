  "name": "4-Count Burpees",
  "category": "Cardio",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. **Start in a standing position** with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Drop down into a squat position, keeping your back straight and your hands on the ground in front of you.\n\n3. From the squat position, kick your legs back, stretching out into a plank position while still keeping your upper body intact. You should now be in a **plank** pose with your hands under your shoulders and your toes touching the ground.\n\n4. Quickly do **four burpee movements**: \n   - from the plank, lower yourself down, keeping your elbows bent, until you're almost in contact with the ground (keep your chest slightly off).\n   - then quickly stand up again from that position.\n   - drop back down into a squat, placing your hands on the ground if needed for support.\n   - kick back up to the plank pose.\n\n5. From the final **fourth burpee** in the sequence, rapidly return your legs forward and jump up out of the burpee form, extending your arms above your head.\n\n6. Land softly with your knees slightly bent to absorb any impact and repeat, starting again at step 3,\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions or seconds/time duration",
