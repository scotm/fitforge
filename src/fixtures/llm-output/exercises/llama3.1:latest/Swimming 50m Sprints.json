  "name": "Swimming 50m Sprints",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in the water at one end of a pool, with your back to the starting point and feet anchored to the bottom.\n\n2. Use a streamlined body position, tucking your chin into your chest and keeping your body as horizontal as possible.\n\n3. Build up speed by using powerful strokes, drawing your arms through the water from a vertical position and pushing off from the bottom with one foot and then the other at different phases of each stroke [e.g. on backstroke - right arm and left leg alternate; on freestyle, butterfly or breaststroke, different arm-leg pairings alternate].\n\n4. Keep your body rotation minimal while using wide overhand strokes. Aim for a consistent speed without sacrificing technique.\n\n5. To maximize efficiency and gain, aim to reach the water surface at the 25-meter mark to prepare yourself psychologically for the final stretch of acceleration.\n\n6. Finish with another sprint of power and propulsion between the 45 and 50 meters marks, aiming a strong, consistent performance throughout your run.\n\n7. Repeat the sprinting exercise over desired number of repetitions with correct warm-up procedure beforehand.",
