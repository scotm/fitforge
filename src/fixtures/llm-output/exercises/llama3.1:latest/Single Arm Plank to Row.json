Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your hips do not sag or pike upwards throughout the movement. \n3. Lift one arm (either left or right) completely off of the ground, keeping it straight. This will be your rowing arm. \n4. Keeping your core engaged and the rest of your body stable, use your rowing arm to lift a light dumbbell or weight from the floor up to your side. Squeeze your shoulder blade together as you perform this movement.\n5. Slowly return the weight to its starting position on the ground with control.\n6. While holding the plank position, alternate sides by switching which arm remains on the ground and which one lifts the weight.",
