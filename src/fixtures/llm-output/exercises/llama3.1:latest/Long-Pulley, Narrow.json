  "how_to_perform": "\n1. Attach the pulley system to a high pulley with the bar at chest height or slightly above.\n2. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip so that your hands face each other. Your shoulders should be relaxed and down, avoiding any scrunching of your neck or tensing of your traps.\n3. Stand facing the machine with your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Keep your back straight, engaging your core to support your spine.\n4. Keeping your body steady, slowly pull the bar towards you, squeezing your shoulders blades together and pulling your chest forward.\n5. Focus on a wide range of motion in the exercise but maintain control and stability throughout each repetition.\n6. Lower the bar back down to the starting position, avoiding any jerky movements that could cause momentum rather than strength to drive the movement.\n7. Once you have completed the desired number of repetitions or reached your optimal range, rest when needed.",
