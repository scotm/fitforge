  "category": "Back",
  "how_to_perform": ". Lie on a flat bench with your back pressed against the pad and a dumbbell in each hand. Hold the handles with your palms facing together, arms extended at shoulder height.\n\n2. Press your shoulders down to engage your lats, which will help control the weight during the movement. Squeeze these muscles by pulling the shoulder blades together, but avoid squeezing your biceps.\n\n3. Slowly lower your arms to one side, keeping them straight, until they are below shoulder level. \n\n4. Focus on using your back muscles (lats) to pull the weights up towards a 90-degree angle.\n\n5. At the top of the movement, squeeze these muscles and pull your shoulders down again.\n\n6. Lower the dumbbells back to the starting position with control, keeping your core engaged and avoiding arching or rounding your lower back.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form throughout the exercise.",
