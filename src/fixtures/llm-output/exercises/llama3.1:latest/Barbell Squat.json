  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand over the barbell, toes pointed forward or slightly outward, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Make sure to keep your lower back in a neutral position and maintain a slight arch in your mid-back.\n2. Reach down and grasp the bar with an overhand grip that is wider than shoulder-width apart. Your hands should be placed outside of your shoulders, but not too close or far away from them.\n\n3. Keep your chest up and shoulders down as you drive your heels into the ground. Engage your core muscles to support your lower back.\n\n4. Hinge forward slightly, lowering your body until the barbell touches your upper thighs. Remember to keep your knees in line with your toes throughout this movement.\n\n\nAs you lower yourself, be sure to keep control over the weight and prevent it from bouncing up past your knees. Avoid letting your heels lift off the ground as you reach the bottom of this movement.\n\n5. Once the bar has made contact with your thighs, pause briefly at the lowest point of the range. Don't bounce and make sure that there's no movement in the joints or muscles.\n\n\nTake note to maintain control over the weight throughout the exercise, keeping it from rising up too high as you explosively stand up.\n\n6. From the bottom position, push through your heels to explosively lift yourself back up to the starting point, keeping your lower back straight and core muscles active.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions with proper form.",
