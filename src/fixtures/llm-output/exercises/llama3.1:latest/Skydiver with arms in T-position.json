Straighten one arm above your shoulder to maintain good positioning of your upper body.\n6. Hold the top position for a brief moment before slowly lowering yourself down by first bending the standing leg and then releasing the raised leg, while letting the arms hang straight down.\n7. Pause briefly at the bottom position.\n8. Step back up to the start position using both legs with control.",
