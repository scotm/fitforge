  "name": "Wall Drills",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your back against a wall, feet shoulder-width apart and at least 12 inches away from the wall.\n2. Slowly slide your back down the wall, keeping your shoulders, ears, and buttocks aligned, until you're in a squatting position.\n3. Hold this position for a brief moment to ensure proper alignment and engage your core muscles (if needed, use a mirror to correct form).\n4. Push back up against the wall, extending your hips and legs fully into standing position.\n5. Repeat this up-and-down motion multiple times for increased range of motion, strength development, and flexibility, but avoid bouncing or over-pressing yourself.\n6. Take breaks as necessary between repetitions and consider adding variations (such as shuffling, crossing one foot in front of the other, etc.) to make the movement more engaging.",
