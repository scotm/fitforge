  "how_to_perform": "# Start by lying on your back with your arms extended overhead and legs straight. \n# Engage your core muscles to maintain a stable lower back position.\n\n1. Lift your legs off the ground and curl them towards your chest, keeping your knees slightly bent.\n2. While in this curled position, rapidly alternate between extending one leg outwards and retracting it back towards your body for about 3-5 repetitions before switching legs.\n3. Continue alternating legs at a steady pace, aiming to get your rate up close to 20 kicks per minute.\n4. Focus on maintaining proper form throughout the exercise by keeping your core engaged and minimizing movement outside of your core's engagement zone.",
