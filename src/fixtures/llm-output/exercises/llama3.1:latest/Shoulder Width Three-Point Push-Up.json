  "name": "Shoulder Width Three-Point Push-Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Start in a position on the ground similar to a traditional push-up**, but rather than placing your hands shoulder-width apart, place them under your chest with one hand directly behind each armpit.\n2. Form an approximately 30-degree angle between each hand and the ground. Your shoulders should be directly above your hands. The distance between your hands may vary depending on your comfort level, but for this exercise, we recommend keeping them shoulder-width apart to maintain proper posture.\n3. Position your feet together with your weight evenly distributed on both legs. Keep your spine elongated, engaging your core muscles to support the movement of your upper body.\n4. Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows, ensuring they are close to your sides and pointing behind you. As you lower yourself down, keep in mind a slight angle will remain between each hand and the ground due to the placement under the armpit, maintaining proper activation in the stabilizer muscles including both chest muscles.\n5. Aim for taking down only until you feel a distinct stretch along your chest muscles, then pause briefly at this bottom position.\n6. When ready, push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms. Control each movement focus on engaging your core throughout to stabilize and generate force from your lower torso.",
