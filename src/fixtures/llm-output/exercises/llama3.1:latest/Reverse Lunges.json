  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet hip-width apart, with a slight forward lean.\n2. Take a large step backwards with your left foot, keeping it in line with the back of your head. Lower your body down into the lunge, aiming to lower down until your right knee is almost touching the ground behind you.\n3. Keep your front knee behind your toes and ensure it remains over or just slightly behind your ankle. This will help maintain alignment and prevent straining any muscles in your legs while reducing wear on your joints.\n4. For each repetition, push through both feet to return to a neutral standing position with your left foot stepping forward to meet the body's center of gravity again.",
