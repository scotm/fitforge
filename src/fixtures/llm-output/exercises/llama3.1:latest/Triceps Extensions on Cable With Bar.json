  "name": "Triceps Extensions on Cable With Bar",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. Attach a bar to the high-pulley cable machine, so that it is at chest height or slightly above.\n2. Stand facing the cable with your back to the high pulley, grasp the bar with an overhand grip, and engage your core.\n\n3. Take a slight step forward with your feet, so that they are shoulder-width apart and parallel to each other, with your dominant foot in front of your body. Your hands will still be directly under the bar.\n4. Keeping your arms completely straight, lift the bar up towards your chest until it is fully extended.\n\n5. Slowly lower the bar behind you, allowing your elbows to bend slightly, but keep them close to your body as you perform this movement. Keep your core and upper back muscles engaged throughout the entire exercise.\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on controlled movements and taking care not to bounce or jerky movements that can compromise form.\n",
