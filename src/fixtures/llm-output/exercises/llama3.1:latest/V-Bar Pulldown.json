Grasp the bar with an overhand grip, hands shoulder-width apart.\n\n3. Keeping your back straight and your core engaged, lift your feet off the ground by pulling your heels towards you to minimize momentum and maintain control.\n\n4. Slowly pull the bar down toward your chest by squeezing your shoulder blades together, keeping your elbows close to your body.\n\n5. Focus on using your lats to pull the bar towards your upper back, avoiding arching your back or swinging the weight.\n\n6. When the bar reaches the top of its travel, pause briefly at the contraction position.\n\n7. Slowly release the bar back to the starting position while maintaining a controlled motion throughout the movement.",
