  "how_to_perform": "# Shrugs on Multipress### Stand in front of a multi-gym bench with the bar at chest height. Position your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with one foot facing forward (parallel to the direction of the bars) and the other foot turned outward at approximately 45-degrees.\n\nGrip the bar with an overhand grip, hands should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Ensure that the bar is in line with your shoulders or slightly above it.\n \n1. First, position all weight onto both legs.\n2. Lift the weights up until your elbows pass over to backside of bar, ensuring that you keep your posture correct - squeeze shoulder blades together.\n3. Slightly bend your knees throughout entire exercise.\n4. Hold for a brief pause, but don't freeze.\n\n5. The movement begins at this point, lowering your shoulders by slightly depressing their placement in space (slightly reducing the distance between them).\n6. In so doing, you cause the bar to lower down and rest over all muscles along upper chest area through this action.\n7. The objective of shrugs is lifting entire bodyweight off the ground using a mechanical pull generated from the top part of both arms combined.\n\n8. Continue alternating the repetition for 3-6 sets.\n\n# Additional tips:* Perform with your torso straight.* Never arch back excessively while doing, otherwise you might strain something elsewhere in spine.* When lower the weight down, keep elbows slightly under the bar. \n",
