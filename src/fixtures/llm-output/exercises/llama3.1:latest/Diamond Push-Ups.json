  "how_to_perform": "# Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body forming a straight line from head to heels.\n# Place your hands under shoulders so that your index fingers point towards each other. This \"diamond\" shape should be formed by the alignment of your fingers underneath yourself.\\n# Engage your core and keep your hips stable throughout the exercise. \\n# Lower your body toward the ground. Your elbows will go back while keeping them close to your body for optimal performance. As the upper part of your chest (pectorals) dips down (hence the name diamond push-ups), stretch it gently yet firmly.\n\\n# Then, return your body to its original height using pectoral muscles.\n\n # Repeat.",
