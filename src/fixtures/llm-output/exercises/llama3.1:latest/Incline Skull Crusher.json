Adjust the bench so that your upper arms remain perpendicular to the floor throughout the exercise.\n### Grip the barbell with an overhand grip, using hands shoulder-width apart. Hold the weight at arm's length across your chest.\n## Slowly lower the bar down towards your forehead by bending both elbows in a shallow arc motion.\n### Pause briefly once you reach the bottom of the movement.\n## Using only your triceps to lift, push the barbell back up to the starting position, keeping your upper arms still and focusing on engaging your triceps throughout the exercise.\n## Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
