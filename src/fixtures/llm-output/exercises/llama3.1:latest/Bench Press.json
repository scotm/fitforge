  "how_to_perform": "# Bench Press\n1. Lie down on a flat bench and grip it with your hands shoulder-width apart.\n2. Place your feet firmly on the ground, ensuring that they're directly under your knees to provide stability and maintain proper form.\n3. Squeeze your glutes and engage your core muscles by pulling your belly button toward your spine.\n4. Lower the bar down onto your chest, keeping it close to your body, until it touches your upper-chest area. Be careful not to let the bar touch or rest on your neck.\n\n5. Push the bar upwards, extending your arms fully until they're locked out. Take a moment to pause at the top of the movement and ensure stability.\n6. Slowly lower the weight down over your chest once more, using proper form to control the descent, keeping the focus on moving with smooth and continuous tension throughout the range of motion.\n7. Perform the desired number of repetitions.",
