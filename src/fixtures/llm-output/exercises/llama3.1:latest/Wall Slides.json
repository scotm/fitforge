  "name": "Wall Slides",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. Stand with your back to a wall and your feet shoulder-width apart.\n2. Take small steps to the side, keeping your back against the wall, until you are able to stand with your body at an angle to the wall (slightly leaning away).\n3. Ensure your front heel is in line with the opposite toe on the other foot, so that when viewed from above, both front and back legs make a straight line.\n4. Keep your chest up, shoulders relaxed, and core engaged throughout the exercise.\n5. Slide one foot forward about 6-8 inches while maintaining contact of the other foot and back against the wall. The slide should be done with soft movement without transferring weight to that leg.\n6. Pause briefly for a half second or as the feeling presents, then slowly move the foot back into its original position (as before).\n7. Continue this sliding on each side with no more than 2 seconds recovery in between movements.",
