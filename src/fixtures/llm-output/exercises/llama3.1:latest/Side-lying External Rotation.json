With your arm above your shoulder, grasp the resistance band/cable as if to do an external rotation.\n\n3. Keeping your upper arm stable, rotate your forearm externally by bringing your hand towards your back and keeping them aligned along your spine.\n\n4. Focus on isolating the rotational movement starting from your mid-shoulder to your wrist without shifting your torso or lower limb position.\n\n5. Hold for a brief moment before returning the arm slowly to its original position. \n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your core tight and your shoulder blades stable throughout.",
