From the squat position, swing both of your hands forward between your legs, placing them flat and together on the ground in front of your feet.\n4. Next, push off from this low position with one hand on the ground and jump your feet backwards into a high plank position.\n5. Immediately drop down to a no-push up burpee by lowering your body until your arms are bent at a 90-degree angle, but without pushing yourself away.\n6.
