  "name": "Snatch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing the weight you will be using for the snatch exercise.\n\n2. **The Catch**: Reach down and take hold of the weight in a front rack position (with the bar resting on your anterior deltoids).\n\n3. **Start to Move Upward Through**: Without changing grip or hand positioning, start to move upward with your legs first, quickly transitioning into a full squat. As you descend, hinge forward at the hips, maintaining contact with the bar.\n\n4. **The Second Movement**: Explode upward from the bottom of the squat/hinge combination and into an upward motion, using all the strength in your lower body, core muscles, and pulling movements from the arms to bring the weight toward your shoulders.\n\n5. **Bar Catching**: Allow yourself sufficient time to react when catching the weight overhead. Aim to make contact near the base of your fingers - on either side of your body. Take note that using only one hand will force you into a 'Single Snatch'.\n\n6. **Lowered Position After Catching**: Upon successfully landing with the barbell over your shoulders, lower it to your hips in control and smoothly rack it. Take care not to let your knees extend beyond your toes during this process, as safety is of utmost importance when performing such movements.\n\n7. Repeat for desired repetitions.",
  "short_summary": "The Snatch is a complex exercise that primarily works the core muscles, legs, glutes, shoulders, back, and upper back and can be performed with a barbell to work nearly every muscle group in a holistic fashion.",
