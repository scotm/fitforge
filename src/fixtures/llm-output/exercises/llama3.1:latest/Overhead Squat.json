  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start with the barbell at your chest or slightly higher, standing with one hand supporting a weight or bar in front of you with the other hand free to perform the overhead hold and movement.\n\n2. Take a deep breath and place both hands firmly on the bar in front of you for balance.\n\n3. Keeping tension in your grip, squeeze your shoulder blades together as your arms and hands position themselves over the object you're holding and preparing for lift-off.\n\n4. Push through and lift off with one foot only (you should start this movement with your feet shoulder-width apart).\n\n5. Lift one leg back into a lunge position keeping that front foot in contact with the ground, and push it away from you about 12-15 inches to help you balance more effectively with your raised hand.\n\n6. Once stable, slowly lift both arms above your head (like holding an imaginary kettlebell or weight straight up) for balance while maintaining this one-legged position.\n\n7. Lower that lifted leg down toward the ground and bring yourself back into a lunge position keeping contact with the other foot on the ground, preparing to complete the movement in full as you go through each cycle of repetitions desired.\n\n8. Once reaching the second part of your squatting phase using both legs (bending), slowly begin lowering those heels until they almost touch the ground.\n\n9. Pause briefly at the lowest point and begin pushing yourself back up through that squat as fast or as controlled as you'd like, with full effort in each push from starting movement on initial leg to reaching up high above your head with arms and completing final push out.\n\n10. For safety's best results always prioritize balance while lowering any weight when exercising.\n\n11. Repeat this process, slowly transitioning each time between squatting movements alternating legs.",
