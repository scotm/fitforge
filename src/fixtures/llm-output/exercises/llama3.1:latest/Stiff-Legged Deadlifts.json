  "name": "Stiff-Legged Deadlifts",
  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell or barbell with an overhand grip, if you don't have enough strength use two dumbbells instead.\n\n2. Keeping your back straight, engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine.\n\n3. Hinge forward at the hips, keeping your knees virtually straight (as much as possible), with a slight incline in your lower back to protect it and avoid injury.\n\n4. Lower your body down, trying to reach for ground with your hands while squeezing and contracting your glutes muscles on bottom portion of the movement.\n\n5. Return to standing position by slowly lifting your torso back up to straight position. Squeeze and contract your core muscles once in the topmost point again, pushing yourself away from all that stress your body carries during this heavy load deadlift movement.\n\n6. Complete several repetitions of the lift according to how much muscle strength you wish build or want to add power to leg muscles.\n\n7. Be sure hold dumbbells with both hands correctly so there is stable support against gravity force always, so do not fall down, get injured and lose confidence in yourself.",
