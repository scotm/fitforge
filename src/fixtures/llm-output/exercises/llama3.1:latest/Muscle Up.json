  "how_to_perform": "1. Find a bar or rig that has two handles, one higher than the other. It should be at least 10 feet off the ground.\n\n2. Start by hanging from the lower handle with your hands shoulder-width apart and your body straight, with no tension in your shoulders.\n\n3. Keeping your shoulders relaxed, slowly lift yourself up towards the upper handle. Keep your elbows close to your body and engage your core muscles.\n\n4. Press down on the bar and extend your arms fully, lifting your entire body off the ground. Your body should be mostly vertical at this point.\n\n5. Hold the upper position of the muscle-up for a brief moment, feeling the contraction in your chest, shoulders, and core muscles.\n\n6. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position, keeping control throughout the movement.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
