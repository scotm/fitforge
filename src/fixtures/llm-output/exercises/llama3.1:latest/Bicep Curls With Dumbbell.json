  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward.\n\n2. Keeping your back straight and core engaged, bend your knees slightly for stability.\n\n3. Contract the biceps muscles to lift the dumbbells up towards your shoulders.\n\n4. As you curl the dumbbells up, keep your upper arms still and only move your forearms to avoid swinging or momentum-based movement.\n\n5. Focus on using your biceps effectively by squeezing at the top of the curl and avoiding any sagging in the shoulders or hips.\n\n6. Pause briefly at the top of the curl.\n\n7. Slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position, avoiding any jerky or uncontrolled movements.\n\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
