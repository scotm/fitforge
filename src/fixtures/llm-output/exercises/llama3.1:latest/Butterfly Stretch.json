Keeping your lower back pressed into the ground, bring one knee towards your chest while keeping your other leg extended on the ground.\n4. Hold for a brief moment, feeling the stretch in your hips and thighs.\n5. Slowly return your first leg to its original position, repeating with the other leg.\n6. Continue alternating legs in this manner, bringing the opposite knee towards your chest each time you switch legs.\n7.
