  "name": "Close-grip Press-ups",
  "category": "Chest",
  "how_to_perform": "* Start in a plank position with your hands shoulder-width apart, but with them closer together than usual. To be specific, place your hands slightly more than shoulder-width, and directly under your chest. This will emphasize activation in the triceps.\n\n* Position your body so that it forms a straight line from head to heels. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine.\n\n* Lower your body by bending your elbows until they are at about a 45-degree angle or slightly more. Keep your shoulders down away from your ears and avoid scrunching up towards the ceiling with your collarbones.\n\n* Continue lowering yourself in this way until your bottom is almost, but not quite touching the ground.\n\n* Pause briefly to check that your form is correct and then push back up to the beginning position using a pressing motion. Think of straightening your arms as driving upward through them, using all of the muscles along your shoulders and chest to help you lift.\n* Lower down with control and repeat the desired number of repetitions.",
  "short_summary": "Close-grip press-ups are a variation of traditional press-ups that primarily work the triceps and chest. This exercise places greater emphasis on these upper body muscles compared with a standard press-up.",
