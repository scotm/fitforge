  "name": "Seated Knee Tuck",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you.\n2. Engage your core and support yourself by placing your hands behind you for balance (if needed).\n3. Lift your right knee towards your chest, keeping your foot flexed and your lower back still.\n4. Quickly bring your left knee up to meet the right one, and then rapidly tuck both knees in towards your chest (a movement that can resemble rapid-fire 'tucks').\n5. Continue alternating and quickly switching legs at a moderate pace, with your core engaged throughout.\n6. Focus on controlling the speed of your movements and maintaining proper form, avoiding any over- or under-engagement that might compromise stability or put unnecessary stress on your back.\n7. When you've completed the desired number of repetitions, slowly lower your legs to the starting position and take a brief break if needed before repeating.",
