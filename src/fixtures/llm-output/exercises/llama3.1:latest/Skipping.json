  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by jumping and landing on a flat surface, with your feet hip-width apart.\n\n2. Push off the ground with both feet, keeping them relatively close together as you jump into the air.\n\n3. Attempt to land mid-air, absorbing the impact with both feet simultaneously.\n\n4. Immediately jump up again and repeat this motion at a fast pace, focusing on quick turnover between jumps.\n\n5. Try to maintain proper form by landing lightly and not overstriding, keeping your knees slightly bent as you absorb the impact of each landing.\n\n6. As fatigue sets in, focus on maintaining the quick and smooth jumping motion while recovering between jumps, ensuring that you're getting the most out of this cardio workout.\n",
