  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by placing your back against an incline bench and slowly lowering yourself into a lying position, with the top of your upper thighs resting at a comfortable angle.\n\n2. Grip the sides of the bench firmly with your fists if needed or place your hands under your lower back for extra support.\n\n3. Engage your core muscles to prepare for movement, keeping your lower back in contact with the lowest point on the incline where possible.\n\n4. Start by lifting your shoulders off the top part of the bench, crunching up towards your knees while trying not to lift them above your hips or arch your lower back beyond its natural curve.\n\n5. Lower the tops of your scapulae and release your core muscles as you return to the starting position.\n\n6. Perform for desired number of repetitions at a moderate pace throughout.",
