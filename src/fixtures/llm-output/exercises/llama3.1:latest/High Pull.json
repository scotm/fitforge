  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing a bar or cable machine with the handle at chest height.\n\n2. Grip the bar or handle firmly with both hands using an overhand grip (palms facing away from you).\n\n3. Engage your core and take a step back into the movement, keeping your body upright and your chest open.\n\n4. Without moving your upper body, pull your arms straight up off the ground towards the ceiling. Keep your elbows slightly bent to reduce strain in your lower back.\n\n5. Focus on squeezing your scapula together at the top of the movement for increased activation in your back and shoulders.\n\n6. Slowly lower your arms back down to the starting position without releasing tension in your upper body or losing engagement in your core.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control throughout each rep.",
