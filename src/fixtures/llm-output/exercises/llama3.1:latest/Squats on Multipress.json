  "how_to_perform": "# Squats on Multipress\n1. Start by standing in front of a multipress machine, with the platform set to the desired height.\n2. Place your feet shoulder-width apart and slightly wider than hip-width, facing the machine.\n3. Engage your core and take note of the proper stance and setup for optimal performance.\n\n4. Lower yourself down into a squat position, keeping your back straight, chest up, head down, shoulders relaxed, and glutes tight.\n5. Lower yourself to the platform height (typically just shorter than knee-level), but not touching it. This would make the movement purely vertical.\n6. Stop for 2â€“3 seconds as you touch each platform once at the midline of your thigh muscles on both sides below 90 degrees in range-of-motion motion.\n7. Then, push yourself back up to standing position maintaining control over the descent,\n8. Repeat with proper posture from 1-50 repetitions (according to training goals and experience) before resting.\n\n",
