  "how_to_perform": "# 1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing a power rack or other support system to allow you to lower yourself without falling.\n\n2. Hold the bar with an overhand grip and place it across your upper chest, just above your shoulders, but not resting on them.\n\n3. Engage your core and take two steps forward from the rack so that the plates are directly in front of you.\n\n4. Keep your back flat against the rack as you bend at the knees, lowering yourself down to a depth where your thighs are parallel with the ground.\n\n5. Focus on keeping the bar in the same position throughout the movement - don't let it wobble and ensure your upper body remains still.\n\n6. Pause for a brief moment, then push up back to the starting position using the power rack for support if needed.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
