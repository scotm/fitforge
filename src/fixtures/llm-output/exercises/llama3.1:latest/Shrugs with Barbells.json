Keeping your upper arms still, engage your core and lift the dumbbells straight up so that they are just below your clavicles.\n\n3. Pause briefly for a split second to squeeze your scapulae (shoulder blades) together.\n\n4. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to their starting position at shoulder height, keeping control throughout the movement.\n\n5. Repeat this process for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining proper form and avoiding any unnecessary strain on your joints.\n",
