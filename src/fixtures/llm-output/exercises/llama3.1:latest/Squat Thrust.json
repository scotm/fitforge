  "name": "Squat Thrust",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Lower your body into a squatting position, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.\n\n3. Place your palms on the ground beside you, directly under your shoulders.\n\n4. From there, kick both your legs backwards at an angle, so that your body forms a V shape with your arms serving as one leg of the V.\n\n5. Your first movement downwards should be a rapid thrusting motion in the opposite direction, such a way that you can end up on top or below your starting point without touching either one.\n\n6. Lower yourself down for 2-3 seconds to stretch your core and legs.\n\n7. Now, explosively launch back upwards using all fours as takeoff points into jump motion of both feet while keeping elbows bent at shoulder level so that once again you stand on feet alone but ready to do the next rep right away.\n",
