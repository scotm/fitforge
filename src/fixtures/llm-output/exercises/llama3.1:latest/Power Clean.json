  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in a standing position with the barbell on the ground at about thigh level. Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and engage your core.\n\n2. Bend down and grip the barbell with both hands shoulder-width apart or slightly wider, keeping your elbows soft and your arms close to your body.\n\n3. Take a small step forward with one foot (lead foot) for stability as you pick up the barbell.\n\n4. As you lift the barbell off the ground, keep it close to your legs and focus on hinging at your hips, rather than just using your back.\n\n5. Keeping your elbows close to your body, swing the barbell upwards, generating power from your entire leg and core muscles, until it's at waist height or slightly above.\n\n6. As you're swinging the bar, aim for a full squat position with the barbell suspended mid-air between your legs.\n\n7. Catch the barbell in this deep squat position with your hands gripping under your shoulders (overhead), using all of your leg strength to support and stabilize the weight.\n\n8. Stand up quickly back to the starting position and repeat for desired reps.",
