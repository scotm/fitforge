  "how_to_perform": "1. Warm up with a light walk or dynamic stretching to get your muscles ready for movement.\n\n2. Start in a relaxed posture, upright and balanced on both feet.\n\n3. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine to maintain stability and balance throughout the exercise.\n\n4. Start moving your legs rapidly, keeping them at a relatively low height so that both heels are off the ground, but still close enough to allow for smooth movement.\n\n5. Focus on quick turnover with each step, using your glutes and calves for propulsion.\n\n6. Bring your legs close together with each step, emphasizing quick transfer of weight from one foot to another.\n\n7. Keep your posture relaxed and forward, with your back straight and core engaged to maintain balance.\n\n8. Engage in controlled breathing by taking deep breaths to help pace yourself and regulate your rhythm.\n\n9. Continue jogging at a steady and fast pace for the desired duration or distance.\n\n10. Finally, gradually slow down as you approach completion.",
