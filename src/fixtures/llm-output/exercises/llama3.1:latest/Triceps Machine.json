  "name": "Triceps Machine",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Adjust the triceps machine to fit your body by pulling or pushing the arm rests in towards you.\n2. Sit down at the machine with your back against the pad and place your elbow into the rest while keeping your upper arm still.\n3. Position your forearm at a 90-degree angle to your upper arm, ensuring that it is resting on the machine's pad.\n4. Grasp the handle firmly but not excessively tightly with both hands.\n5. Extend your forearm and push the weight away from you by straightening your elbow until it is fully extended. You should feel tension in your triceps as you lift.\n6. Slowly lower yourself into a longer position, keeping your upper arm still, until the movement feels challenging but not impossible to keep going.\n7. Pause briefly at the bottom of the range, focusing on the sensation in your triceps as you rest.\n8. Push through with your forearms and extend past the point where you feel comfortable or challenged. \n9. Repeat for your desired repetitions.",
