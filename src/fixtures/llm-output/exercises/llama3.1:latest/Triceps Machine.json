  "how_to_perform": "1. Sit down on the machine with your back against the pad and place your arms straight out in front of you, resting your hands on the armrests.\n\n2. Adjust the machine so that your upper arms are secured under the pads and only your forearms are hanging down, with your hands gripping the bar.\n\n3. With your arms completely extended, press the bar downward by straightening your elbows. This will require the contraction of your triceps muscles.\n\n4. Continue to lower the weight down until you have fully extended your elbows.\n\n5. Then, lift the bar back up to the starting position, extending your elbows.\n\n6. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
