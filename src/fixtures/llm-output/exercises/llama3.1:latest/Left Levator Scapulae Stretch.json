  "name": "Left Levator Scapulae Stretch",
  "category": "Stretch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand or sit with your body positioned to the left of the muscle you want to stretch.\nStand behind a chair for support, if needed.\n\n2. Place your right hand on top of your head, and hold it firmly. Use this hand to apply gentle traction (pulling forces) in an upward direction, keeping your elbow straight and not jerking your arm upwards suddenly.\nThis should help relax the levator scapulae muscles on the left side.\n\n3. Hold for 30 seconds or until you feel a sustained stretch in the muscle on that side of your neck.\nKeep breathing normally throughout this time while maintaining control over your body's position to prevent any accidental movements.\n\n\n4. Release and take a few deep breaths before attempting another repetition if desired.\n\n\n\n5. Repeat as needed for left-sided improvements, making sure not to force too much beyond what feels comfortable due to discomfort on your opposite side (shoulder/neck strain)",
