  "name": "Close-grip Lat Pulldown",
  "category": "Back",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by sitting at a lat pulldown machine with your knees securely under the knee pad and your feet flat on the floor.\n\n2. Reach out and grasp the bar with a close grip (about shoulder-width apart) and keep your elbows at an 8-9 inch distance from them.\n\n3. Engage your core, shoulders, and lower back by pulling your belly button towards your spine and keep it straight throughout the exercise.\n\n4. Slowly pull yourself backwards toward your tailbone while keeping your arms fully extended (though you should avoid locking out your elbows).\n\n5. Focus on squeezing your lats by bringing your shoulders down towards your knees and feel the stretch in your upper back.\n\n6. Pause briefly at the top position of the movement to ensure that the force is coming from the lats.\n\n7. Slowly allow yourself to move forward again until you are in a neutral position, keeping your elbows high throughout the exercise.\n\n8. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
