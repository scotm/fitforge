  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by getting into a kneeling position, with your knees bent at 90 degrees and your back straight.\n\n2. Sit down onto the balls of your feet to maintain proper form and prevent strain on your lower back.\n\n3. Place your hands beside you for support but not resting on them, in case you need to catch yourself during the motion.\n\n4. Engage your core muscles to keep your pelvis stable and maintain a straight spine throughout the movement.\n\n5. Lean backward slightly, keeping your arms extended behind you and extending your buttocks downward at an angle of about 45 degrees from where your legs are situated.\n\n6. Slowly lower one leg backward as far back as possible while maintaining control over your body, stretching your hamstrings and glutes.\n\n7. Pause briefly when your leg is fully extended before slowly bringing it back up to the starting position.\n\n8. Perform this motion on both legs for equal repetitions, focusing on targeting the correct range of movement within the muscle groups involved.",
