  "name": "Suspended Crosses",
  "how_to_perform": "1. To begin, find a sturdy suspension trainer or resistance band that allows for a relatively wide range of motion.\n2. Stand facing the anchor point with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold the handles firmly in each hand.\n3. Inhale deeply while preparing to load the shoulders with your desired grip; some variations recommend using a neutral (palms facing towards you), pronated (palms facing behind you), or supinated (palms facing up) grip.\n\n4. Maintain engagement from your core, drawing your pelvis slightly towards the anchor point and creating balance.\n5. Begin by pulling downwards to load the shoulders with desired intensity, using a smooth motion to generate control. Focus on developing stability and resisting rotation within your torso.\n6. Perform the desired number of repetitions while paying attention to engaging your muscles. Take note of proper body positioning, such as keeping hips in line with your anchor point and avoiding slouching or leaning forward.\n\n7. Once you've completed the targeted set count, reverse direction by slowly pulling yourself up into a neutral position above the anchor.\n8. Throughout the exercise, focus on moving smoothly while controlling arm movement.",
