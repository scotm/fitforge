  "name": "Side Slides + Squats",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart**, facing one direction.\nYou can face either left or right, but maintain the same movement throughout both sides.\n\n2. From this standing position, take a small step to the side and slide along that side as far as you comfortably can, keeping your feet parallel to each other. As soon as you reach the edge your feet touch or can't move farther without stepping out of the exercise zone (determined by a person's height), stand back up with your left foot (if facing right) or your right foot (if facing left).\n\n3. Without taking a step, transition directly into a squat. Your weight should be primarily on one leg in the side slide part of this move.\n\n4. Keeping all your contact points stable with each other and the floor, hold an actual **Squat Position** - engaging both legs while you lift your knees off the ground by only bending at your ankles.\n\n5. Hold for a bit and **stand back up to the starting position**, keeping control throughout all phases of the move. Do a few reps this way if needed.\n\n\n6. Repeat on the other side, switching which leg you step out with when you perform the sideways movement.\n\n7. Be consistent, making sure that there is balance during every single repetition.",
