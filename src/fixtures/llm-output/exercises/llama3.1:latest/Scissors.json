  "name": "Scissors",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet together, with your arms extended to the sides at about shoulder height.\n\n2. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back straight and your core engaged.\n\n3. Lift one leg and bring it towards the opposite side of your body, as if you are cutting an imaginary lawn with a pair of scissors (hence the name).\n\n4. As you lift your first leg, lower the second leg until they almost touch each other, but not quite.\n\n5. Quickly switch legs, lifting the first leg back up and lowering the second leg towards it once again.\n\n6. Continue alternating legs rapidly, using your hips to generate momentum for a smooth and efficient movement.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your core tight and your movements controlled throughout the exercise.",
