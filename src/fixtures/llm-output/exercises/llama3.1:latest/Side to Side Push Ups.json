  "name": "Side to Side Push Ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by facing forward and placing your hands shoulder-width apart on the ground, keeping them slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your hips do not sag or pike upwards throughout the movement.\n\n3. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest nearly touches the ground.\n\n4. Swiftly transition to a side-lying position, placing your weight on one arm and using it to push the ground away from you as you lift the other arm off the floor.\n\n5. Keeping your core engaged, shift your body to the other side, allowing the first arm to touch the ground while pushing upward with the second arm.\n\n6. Continue alternating sides, moving in a slow and controlled manner that challenges both arms and increases overall stability.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your movements controlled and your core tight throughout the exercise.",
