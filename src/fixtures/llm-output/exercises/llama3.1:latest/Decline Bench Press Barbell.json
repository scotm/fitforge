  "how_to_perform": "1. Adjust a decline bench to a steep angle, with your feet locked into place at one end of the bench.\n2. Lie down on the Decline Bench with your feet firmly planted in the footpads and your body positioned with the incline facing upwards.\n3. Place your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of the Decline Barbell's center grip, wrapping your fingers around it to create a firm handposition.\n\n4. Engage your core, keeping your spine neutral.\n5. As you prepare to press the barbell upwards, ensure that you keep your back level with your quads. Any tilt or lean away from the upright could strain your lower back.\n\n6. Lower the bar down slowly until it grazes just above your chest-level by bending your elbows. Keep your upper arms fairly locked throughout this entire process.\n\n7. Focus on keeping the movement smooth and controlled throughout both phases â€“ lowering, then lifting.",
