  "how_to_perform": "1. Find a suitable cycling environment, such as a stationary bike or an actual bicycle.\n\n2. Adjust the bike seat and handlebars to fit your body. You should be able to flat-foot on the ground with one leg when sitting in the saddle.\n\n3. Start pedaling at a moderate pace, ensuring that you are using proper pedal strokes (pushing through the power phase and retrieving during the restive phases).\n\n4. Focus on consistent and efficient cycling techniques, engaging your core, shoulders, arms, and legs as needed throughout the movement.\n\n5. As you become more familiar with the movement, increase or decrease the resistance to challenge yourself at different intensity levels.\n\n6. To enhance the effectiveness of cycling, incorporate interval training into your routine (mixing fast-paced bursts with slower paced recovery periods).\n\n7. Always prioritize proper ergonomics and body positioning throughout the exercise.",
