Lift your feet off the ground and, with your arms straight, hoist yourself up by pulling down on the bar with your hands.\n5.

Pause briefly at the top of the movement.\n\n7. To begin dismounting from the bar, slowly lower yourself down by releasing the grip with your hands.\n8. Land quietly in a neutral position, ensuring that you maintain proper form throughout the exercise.",
