  "how_to_perform": "1. Find a bar or ledge that's at least waist-high and slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Grasp the bar with an underhand grip, making sure your hands are slightly wider than your shoulders.\n\n2. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine. Keep your body straight and tight, avoiding any sagging or leaning forward.\n\n3. As you lift up to get onto the bar, use your hips and legs to help drive yourself upward, rather than relying solely on your arms. Make sure to keep your weight focused over your toes.\n\n4. Once up onto the bar, walk your feet out a bit if needed and make any necessary adjustments to find a comfortable position with neutral body alignment.\n\n5. Hold onto the bar using an underhand grip while maintaining proper form and positioning throughout.\n\n6. Keeping a tight line from nose to heels, lift yourself up by pulling down on the bar, straightening your arms fully and drawing your body up towards it. Avoid swinging or jerky movements that could put unnecessary stress on your joints.\n\n7. Slowly lower back down to the starting position, making sure not to let yourself swing and regain momentum before coming to rest against the bar.\n\n8. Keep repeating the motion for the desired number of repetitions while maintaining proper form and technique throughout the exercise.",
