  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand facing a cable machine with the handle at chest or shoulder height, depending on your body positioning.\n2. Grasp the handle with both hands using an underhand grip, ensuring that your arms are straight and parallel to each other.\n3. Keeping your back straight, move away from the machine until tension is felt in the cables.\n4. Take a small step to one side and lift your chest upwards while keeping the target shoulder below the cable's path of motion, so the cables cross above the working arm.\n5. Focus on squeezing the delts together at the top and lowering back down slowly without losing control of the movement.\n6. Hold onto the machine for any support needed during the exercise.\n7. Replicate the same motion with your other arm to ensure both sides are worked equally.",
