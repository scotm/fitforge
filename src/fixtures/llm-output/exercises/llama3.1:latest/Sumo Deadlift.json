  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start with your feet shoulder-width apart, but slightly wider than your body's natural stance. Place your toes pointing outward, away from the center of your body.\n\n2. Hold a weight or barbell with an overhand grip, making sure to lift your elbows off your hips and to maintain a straight line from head to heels. \n\n3. Bend at your knees, lowering your body down towards the ground, keeping your back straight and squeezing your glutes as you descend.\n\n4. As you lower yourself, reach forward slightly with your feet while maintaining good posture.\n\n5. Keep your chest high and shoulders relaxed, focus on engaging your core throughout the movement.\n\n6. Reach low enough to grip the weight or barbell with an overhand grip.\n\n7. Drive through your heels, straighten your legs and squeeze your glutes to lift the weight off the ground, fully extending your body.\n\n8. Focus on keeping your posture correct during the entire range of motion, maintaining a tall spine throughout all four planes of movement (sagittal, frontal, transverse), as well as a vertical posture, squeezing your glutes upon full extension to minimize excessive sway and instability in lower back region.\n    \n9. Hold at the top of the lift for about 1-2 breaths then slowly repeat the process for the desired numberof repetitions.",
