  "name": "Sumo Deadlift",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in a standing position with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointed outward (forming a 'V' shape).\n\n2. Bend down and grasp an object with both hands using an underhand grip (palm-facing up), keeping your back straight and your core engaged.\n\n3. Take note of the positioning of your feet and body. Your feet should be pointing outward in a 'sumo' stance, whereas traditional deadlifts involve standing with feet shoulder-width apart or narrower.\n\n4. As you lift the object off the ground, make sure to keep your back straight and your core locked throughout the movement.\n\n5. Push through your heels as you lift the object towards hip-level, squeezing your glutes at the top of the movement to target additional muscle groups.\n\n6. Slowly lower the weight down to the starting position by bending your knees and keeping your back straight.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, ensuring proper form and control throughout.",
