  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine. Tighten your lower abs as if you're doing a crunch, but instead of lifting your shoulders off the ground, keep them pressed into the surface.\n\n3. Slowly lift your shoulders off the ground and hover just above the surface for about 1-2 seconds. Try to maintain contact with the floor but avoid touching it with your backside.\n\n4. Hold that position for a brief moment before returning to the start position. Repeat this motion for the desired number of repetitions.\n\n5. As you do each repetition, focus on using your abs and lower back muscles together to lift and lower your torso.\n6. Gradually build up your endurance by increasing the number of repetitions over time.",
