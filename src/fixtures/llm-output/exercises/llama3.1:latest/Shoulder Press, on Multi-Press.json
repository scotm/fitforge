Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the shoulder press handles, holding them tightly but not too tightly as this can cause unnecessary strain on your shoulders.\n\n4. Keep your arms straight and your palms facing backwards.\n\n5. Extend your arms fully by pressing upwards with your shoulders, but do not lock out your elbows.\n\n6. Take a brief moment to engage your core muscles and squeeze them gently while holding the top position of the movement.\n\n7. Slowly lower the weight back down to the starting position, taking your time and letting the machine assist you in controlling the descent.\n\n8. Follow the recommended number of repetitions based on your training goals.",
