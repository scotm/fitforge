Stand with the barbell on a rack or platform set to a height of 2-3 inches below your normal deadlift floor level, if you don't have a suitable low-mobility training situation.\n\n2. Place the feet shoulder-width apart and position yourself in front of the rack so that your shins are almost touching it.\n\n3. Grip the bar with your hands wider than shoulder-width, if possible, to maintain optimal back positioning.\n\n4. Keeping your lower back pressed into a neutral spine, and take a deep breath as you prepare for the lift.\n\n5. As you exhale, keep your body straight from head to heels, hinge at your hips, and bend down towards the bar until it meets your shins. \n\n6. Lift with your hips and knees, allowing them to generate force through this movement while maintaining an engagement in your back muscles.\n\n7. Keep moving towards standing position with this load, keeping pressure on both the floor.\n\n8. Upon reaching upright standing, keep control over the movement at all times.\n\n9. Hold for a brief moment before slowly lowering the load down toward your body until you return to the lowered position and rest.",
