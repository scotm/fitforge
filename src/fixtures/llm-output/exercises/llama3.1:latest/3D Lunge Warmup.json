  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Initiate the 3D lunge warm-up by standing with your feet hip-width apart, with one foot in front of the other and turning in slightly to target the hips.**\n\n2. Engage your core muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine, maintaining a stable pelvis.\n\n3. Lower your back knee down onto a mat or soft surface, keeping it behind you at 90 degrees to your body.\n\n4. Step forward with your other foot and hinge forward slightly, keeping the ball of that foot in contact with the ground.\n\n5. Bend both knees to initiate movement.\n\n6. Explode back up into standing position by pushing through your front heel, and rapidly step out with your first foot from step 3 and repeat this alternating movement for the desired duration or interval.\n\n7. Throughout each repetition ensure proper posture with good form: shoulders down relaxed feet flat in the ground, body engaged to maintain stability and prevent excessive strain of your joints and back muscles.",
