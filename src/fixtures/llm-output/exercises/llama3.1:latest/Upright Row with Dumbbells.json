Your grip should be comfortable and consistent throughout the exercise.\n\n3. Bend down slightly to let your arms hinge at a 10-20 degree angle between your chest and your hands. Keep your back straight and engage your core as mentioned earlier.\n\n4. Allow yourself to lean forward very slightly as you begin to draw the dumbbells towards your rib cage, keeping them close to your body throughout.\n\n5. Maintain control over the weight as it approaches its natural stopping point close to the top of the movement (around chest height). Squeeze the muscles in your shoulders and trapezius.\n\n6. Slowly reverse the motion by letting the dumbbells descend back down to the starting position, keeping them close to your body as you do so.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, maintaining control over the movement throughout.",
