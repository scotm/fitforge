  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing in between a set of parallel bars, with one bar on either side of you. Grip each bar firmly with your palms facing inward (towards your body).\n\n2. Lift yourself up off the ground by pressing down on the bars and extend your arms fully. Your legs should be hanging straight down and your body shouldn't be touching the bars.\n\n3. Keep your core engaged and your body upright. Lean slightly forward to emphasize activation in the chest muscles. Keep your elbows close to your body.\n\n4. Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows tucked in close to your sides as you lower yourself. Lower until your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle or slightly below. Feel the stretch in your chest and triceps.\n\n5. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement.\n\n6. Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms. Ensure your movements are controlled, focusing on using your chest and triceps to lift.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your core tight and your movements controlled throughout the exercise.",
