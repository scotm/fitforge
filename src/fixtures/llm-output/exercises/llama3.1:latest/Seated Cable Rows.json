  "how_to_perform": "# Seated Cable Rows\n1. Sit on a seated cable row machine with your feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.\n2. Bend over and take each handle in an underhand grip, so that your hands are shoulder-width apart and your arms are straight.\n\n3. Keep your back straight, core engaged, and shoulders relaxed throughout the exercise.\n4. Pull one handle towards you until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle or slightly higher.\n5. Focus on squeezing your lats and pulling your shoulder blades together as you pull the handle.\n6. Slowly return the handle to its original position without letting it swing back sharply. Avoid arching your lower back.\n\n7. Repeat with alternating arms for one set, then switch arms in subsequent sets. Adjust the seat height if necessary to accommodate a range of motion that doesn't require leaning forward.\n\n8. Perform three to four sets of the desired number of repetitions for optimal results and progression.",
