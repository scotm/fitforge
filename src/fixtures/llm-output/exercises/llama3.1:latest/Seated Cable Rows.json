  "how_to_perform": "**1. Adjust the seated row machine so that a cable is hanging down at an angle, with one end attached to each side of a seat or bench.**\n\n\n**2. Sit at the machine with your feet flat on the floor and your back straight. Your knees should be at 90-degree angles if possible.**\n\n\n**3. Grasp the bar attached to the cable with both hands, shoulder-width apart and palms facing toward each other.**\n\n\n**4. Squeeze your shoulders down and back as you prepare for the exercise, keeping your core muscles engaged.**\n\n\n**5. Draw the bar towards your chest by pulling the cable handle toward you, rather than lifting with your arms. Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the movement.**\n\n\n**6. Pause briefly at the end of the row motion to maintain good form and ensure proper muscle activation.**\n\n\n**7. Return the bar to its starting position, avoiding swinging or jerking movements that could destabilize the machine. Repeat for desired number of repetitions.",
