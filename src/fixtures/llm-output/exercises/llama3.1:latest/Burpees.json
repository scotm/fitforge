  "how_to_perform": "# Start in a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n1. Begin by dropping down into a squatting position, keeping your back straight and engaging your core for stability and balance.\n2. Place your hands on the ground directly under your shoulders and take a deep breath as you begin your descent into the plank position.\n3. Quickly move your legs backward into a plank position with your body forming a straight line from head to heels.\n4. Do a push-up in this plank position, engaging your core for stability of your lower back and abs muscles throughout the exercise.\n5. Next, quickly return to the squatting position by moving your feet forward onto the ground.\n6. From here, jump up into an upright standing position with the force you can muster from the muscle activation of your glutes and legs.\n7. Immediately drop down into another burpee as soon as possible in the same spot,\n8. Ensure that each repetition is performed explosively and consistently throughout the workout to keep intensity maximized.",
