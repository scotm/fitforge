  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and engage your core muscles to maintain a stable posture.\n\n2. Slowly lift one leg off the ground while keeping it straight, with a focus on squeezing your abdominal muscles to stabilize your body.\n3. Hold for a brief moment at the top of the movement, then slowly lower your leg back down without touching the floor, instead holding yourself up with just your arms and other leg.\n\n4. Alternate legs by lifting one up and then the other in rapid succession, attempting to avoid unnecessary hip swivels that could disrupt proper form.\n5. Aim for 15-20 seconds of continuous movement, taking a brief pause afterwards before repeating if you prefer to add a time challenge or otherwise try varying your pace.\n\n6. Throughout this standing leg raise sequence, prioritize maintaining balance and stability on one foot while keeping the legs and core active,\n7. End when you feel as though you've performed for 15 seconds and drop your raised leg but do not set it back fully down.",
  "short_summary": "Leg raises are an isolation exercise focusing primarily in engaging quadriceps as well as other muscles in lower body (hamstrings, glutes), done while standing upright",
