  "name": "Skipping - Standard",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.\n\n2. Begin to swing one leg forward in a circular motion, as if running on the spot. Land softly on the ball of the foot and spring upward to propel the next step.\n\n3. Swing the other leg forward to meet the first leg, keeping them close together while still landing lightly on the balls of your feet.\n\n4. Continue alternating legs at a moderate pace, focusing on quick turnover of each step. Keep your arms relaxed by your sides or let them swing freely.\n\n5. Maintain proper posture and keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to get the most out of it.\n\n6. Breathe naturally while skipping, in sync with the rhythm of the movement. Focus on efficient energy transmission from one foot to the next.",
