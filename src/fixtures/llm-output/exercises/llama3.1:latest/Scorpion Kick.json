  "name": "Scorpion Kick",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying on your stomach with your arms at your sides and your legs straight.\n2. Lift your right arm off the ground and place it behind your back, while simultaneously lifting your left leg up and over your body. Your left leg should be in a position where your heel is near or just above your glutes.\n3. As you lift your left leg, engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine. This will help maintain a stable position throughout the exercise.\n4. Keep your right arm extended behind your body and your left foot flexed as you maintain this position.\n5. Hold for a brief moment at the top of the movement to contract your abdominals further.\n\nTo return to the starting position:\n\n6. Slowly lower your left leg back down to the ground, while keeping your right arm in its original position behind your body.\n7. As you take your left leg off the ground, focus on squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips towards the ceiling. This helps to engage your hip flexors as you extend your hip.\n8. Once you've returned to a more neutral starting position, take a brief pause before repeating with the opposite side (i.e., lifting your right arm up behind your body and lifting your left leg high).\n9. Repeat on the other side for an equal amount of repetitions.",
