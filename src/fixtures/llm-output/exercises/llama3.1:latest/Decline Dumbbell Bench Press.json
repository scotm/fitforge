  "how_to_perform": "1. Place a decline bench on an incline (higher at one end) facing it with your feet shoulder-width apart.\n\n2. Lie down on the bench, positioning the dumbbells over your chest with your hands grasping them firmly and your palms facing each other.\n\n3. Lower the dumbbells to your sides by bending your elbows until they're about 45 degrees or slightly lower, keeping close to your body. Maintain core engagement throughout this movement.\n\n4. Pushing through the dumbbell's handles with both arms, extend back up to the starting position slowly and smoothly.\n\n5. Once fully extended, pause momentarily in this position for better tension on the chest muscles.\n\n6. Repeat this process for the desired number of repetitions while avoiding unnecessary momentum from speed or uncontrolled movements.",
