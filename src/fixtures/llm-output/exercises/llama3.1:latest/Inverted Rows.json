Keeping your feet flat on the ground, pull yourself up towards the bar by lifting your heels off the ground and leaning back slightly.\n\n4. Lower yourself back down to a suspended position, keeping your elbows close to your body and your shoulders relaxed.\n\n5. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on squeezing your lats and pulling muscles at the top of the movement.\n\n6.
