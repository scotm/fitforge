  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by sitting on the edge of a chair, bench, or bed with your hands gripping the edge and your body straight.\n\n2. Lift yourself up off the seat by pressing down on the edge and extend your arms fully. Your legs should be straight out to the sides and your body shouldn't be touching the edge.\n\n3. Keep your core engaged and your body upright. Lean slightly forward to emphasize activation in the upper back and shoulder muscles. Keep your elbows close to your body.\n\n4. Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows. Keep your elbows tucked in close to your sides as you lower yourself. Lower until your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle or slightly below. Feel the stretch in your chest, shoulders, and triceps.\n\n5. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement.\n\n6. Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your arms. Ensure your movements are controlled, focusing on using your upper body muscles to lift.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your core tight and your movements controlled throughout the exercise.",
