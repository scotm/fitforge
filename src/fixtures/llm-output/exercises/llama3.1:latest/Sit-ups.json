  "category": "Abs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.\n2. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine.\n3. Place your hands behind your head for support, but avoid interlacing your fingers or using them to lift your chest off the ground.\n4. Slowly lift your torso upwards towards your knees, curled up and targeting the abdominal muscles.\n5. Keep your pelvis down towards the ground to maintain a consistent angle of elevation for your torso (avoid tucking one side more than the other to ensure balanced engagement across all ab muscles).\n6. Lower back down without touching your upper body part with the ground; instead focus on reaching the bottom position gently by straightening out your torso without breaking form, letting it rest against gravity before attempting another rep from this state.\n7. As you rise up during each successive sit-up attempt feel strong pressure around middle core and deeper into ab area.",
  "short_summary": "Sit-ups target primarily the abdominal muscles in conjunction with some assistance to engage your lower back.",
