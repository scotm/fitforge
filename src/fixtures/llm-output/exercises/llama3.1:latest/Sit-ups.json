  "name": "Sit-ups",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground, keeping them hip-width apart. Place your hands behind you for support.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine and maintaining a neutral position of your pelvis and lower back.\n\n3. Slowly lift your torso up, curling upward while keeping your shoulders down. Focus on using the muscles in your abs, avoiding relying on momentum or bending at the waist instead.\n\n4. Only lift as high as you can maintain with control. You should be able to see your belly button and feel engagement in the abdominal muscles.\n\n5. Hold for a brief moment at the top of the movement.\n\n6. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position, maintaining control throughout the descent.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number repetitions, keeping proper form and engaging core muscles throughout the exercise.",
