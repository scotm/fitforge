  "name": "Side split squats left",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. **Start by standing with your feet wide apart to one side, with your left foot facing forwards and your right foot angled at about a 45-degree angle (towards the back).**\n\n2. Ensure your weight is evenly distributed between both feet, with your knees bent slightly.\n\n3. Slowly lower your body down into a lunge position by bending one knee (your left), keeping your other leg straight (your right).\n\n4. Allow your arms to extend straight out in front of you for balance and engage your core muscles throughout the entire exercise.\n\n5. Lower until your back knee is almost touching the ground or as low as is comfortable for you without feeling any pain or strain in your joints.\n\n6. Hold this position briefly before beginning the ascent with a slow and controlled movement.\n\n7. While squeezing your glutes at the top of the exercise, slowly lift your lower body up to the starting position.\n\n8. Repeat on the other side by switching your feet to target the right leg.\n",
