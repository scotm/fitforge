  "category": "Arms",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Hold a cable handle with your arms straight and elbows locked, at shoulder height.\n\n2. The handle should be held slightly off to one side of the body, with the long axis of the handle running down alongside the arm.\n\n3. Keeping the elbow stationary, use the rotation in the shoulder joint to move the forearm outward and away from the body.\n\n4. Rotate the cable outwards using only your upper back and shoulders. Keep your core tight throughout the movement.\n\n5. Focus on rotating your entire shoulder blade around your stable elbow.\n\n6. Hold the position for a brief moment at the outermost point of rotation, then slowly rotate it back to the starting position.\n\n7. Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.",
  "short_summary": "Cable External Rotation is an isolated exercise that effectively targets the muscles in the shoulders and can be modified by adjusting cable angle or using different handle shapes.",
