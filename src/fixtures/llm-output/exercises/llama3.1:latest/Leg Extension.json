  "how_to_perform": "1. Sit at a leg extension machine with the ankle rest secured under your heel and the knee pad positioned just above the midpoint of your shin.\n\n2. Engage your core by drawing your belly button towards your spine and squeeze your shoulder blades together to maintain stability throughout the exercise.\n\n3. Extend your legs as high as comfortably possible, pausing for a brief moment at the top of the movement to ensure full contraction in your quadriceps muscles.\n\n4. Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position by bending your knees. Maintain control over the descent and avoid letting your legs drop rapidly towards the ground.\n\n5. Repeat the motion for the desired number of repetitions, keeping your core engaged and your movements precise.",
