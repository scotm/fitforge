Place the balls of your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart on the ground, ensuring you are stable and balanced before attempting the squat.\n\n3. Your knees should be placed over the edges of the box or at the top step of a staircase if using one instead.\n\n4. Lower your body down into a seated position by bending your knees, keeping them in-line with the box and ensuring that your back remains flat against the box throughout the movement. \n\n5. Push through your heels to return to standing, squeezing your glutes and quads at the top of the movement to emphasize engagement in the targeted muscles.\n\n6. Ensure a slow and controlled movement throughout the entire exercise, focusing on using your legs and glutes to power each repetition.",
