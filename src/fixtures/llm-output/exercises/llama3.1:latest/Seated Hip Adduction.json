  "how_to_perform": "1. Sit on a hip adductor machine at the gym, or use a resistance band attached to a stable object.\n\n2. Place the middle of the resistance band below your knees, just above the ankle joint. Position them in line with each other.\n\n3. Slowly lift both legs outwards and away from each other until they are straight. Be careful not to swing or jerk the movement.\n\n4. Pause briefly at the top of the movement.\n\n5. Slowly push both legs back together towards your body, keeping them parallel to each another, using the muscles in front of your hip.\n\n6. Continue alternating between extending and adducting (moving together) for multiple repetitions, focusing on contracting and releasing the adductor muscles at a controlled pace.",
