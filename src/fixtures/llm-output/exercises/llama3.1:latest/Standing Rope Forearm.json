  "category": "Arms",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand facing a pull-up bar with a hanging rope, or a thick, sturdy bar or rod from which to hang and perform the exercise.\n\n2. Place both hands shoulder-width apart on the bar, with your hands positioned at about chest-level and your arms straight.\n\n3. Make sure not to rotate your shoulders forward; instead, keep them neutral and engaged for proper form.\n\n4. Slowly lift yourself up by pulling down and using your forearms, keeping your elbows close to your body.\n\n5. As you continue to pull, ensure that only the handle of the rope is moving away from your chest; if your body begins to rise or move upwards, correct your form to maintain focus on the target area.\n\n6. To challenge yourself further or achieve different levels of engagement in specific muscle groups, experiment with changes in grip (such as using a shoulder-width underhand grip) and arm positioning",
