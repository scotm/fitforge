  "name": "Side Split Squats Right",
  "how_to_perform": "\n1. Stand with your feet together, take a large step to one side (in this case, the right).\n2. Keeping your back straight, bend both of your knees and slowly lower yourself until you create an angle between your body and the floor that is greater than 90 degrees.\n3. Both legs should be positioned so that your back leg forms a straight line with your body while also touching the ground directly next to your right foot, with your front leg's thigh in contact or nearly in contact with your upper body as you perform this movement.\n4. Keep your weight evenly distributed between both feet and keep your front knee behind the toes of your front foot if possible. Make sure that your lower back does not arch or sag while performing this exercise.\n5. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement to ensure all muscle groups are engaged properly.\n6. Slowly return to standing by pushing down on both legs and extending them fully, making sure to straighten the knee of the front leg before returning to the initial position.",
