  "name": "Dumbbell Sumo Deadlift",
  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, but turn your feet outward so that they are at a 45-degree angle to the direction you will be lifting.\n\n2. Bend down and grasp two dumbbells by their handles using an overhand grip, resting them on the floor in front of you.\n\n3. Keeping your back straight and core muscles engaged, lift both dumbbells up towards your knees while keeping your feet stable.\n\n4. Instead of bringing the dumbbells to your sides like a traditional deadlift, keep them forward at shoulder height.\n\n5. As you lift, hinge at the hips and lift your torso, squeezing your glutes and pushing your hips back as if you're going to sit down in an invisible chair.\n\n6. Extend your spine and use hip drive to pull the dumbbells off the floor, keeping them straightened out and close to your thighs.\n\n7. Hold for a brief moment at the top of the movement before slowly lowering yourself back down to the starting position, careful not to allow your torso to bend downward as you return the weights to the ground.",
