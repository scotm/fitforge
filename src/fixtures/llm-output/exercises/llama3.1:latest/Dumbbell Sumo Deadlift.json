  "name": "Dumbbell Sumo Deadlift",
  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward and away from midline.\n\n2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand such that the ends of the dumbbells are at hip level, dumbbells facing away from midline.\n\n3. Slightly arch your lower back and tilt your pelvis upwards to maintain natural spinal curvature and engage core muscles.\n4. Keeping dumbbells parallel to ground, bend down by flexing knees and hips joints. Allow entire spine to hunch as you begin lowering yourself downward toward the floor with the weight in your hands.\n\n5. As you finish a full range of motion in deadlift, squeeze shoulder and upper arm bones together; use this position to stabilize your torso throughout exercise execution.\n \n6. Take care that feet never touch or roll backward while lifting because it can cause an increase risk of overuse strains due in part to uncontrolled momentum generated upon reaching top lift position when attempting heavier dumbbell load than intended target strength output goal.",
