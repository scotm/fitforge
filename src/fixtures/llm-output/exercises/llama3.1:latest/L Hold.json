  "name": "L Hold",
  "category": "Stretch",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Find a doorway with the height of your choice, depending on how long you want to stretch out to.\n2. Place the arch of your back and abdomen against the doorframe. Stretch out to the sides so that your shoulders touch the doorframe.\n3. Step forward with one foot, keeping it close to the ground. Your weight will be evenly distributed between both feet but shifted slightly forward on the other foot. The further you stretch, the more your body weight is lifted by your back and glutes.\n4. Lean forward, pushing your palms into the doorframe if needed for stability. This helps deepen the stretch and engages multiple muscle groups simultaneously.\n5. Hold the position and breathe deeply to relax and feel the stretch in your muscles.",
