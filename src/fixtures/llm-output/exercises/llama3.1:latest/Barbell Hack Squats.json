  "name": "Barbell Hack Squats",
  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Setup**: Stand on the floor with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.\n\n2. Hold a barbell with an overhand grip, hands positioned just outside your shoulders.\n\n3. Lower yourself down into a squat position, keeping your back straight and your core engaged. As you lower, bend at the hips and knees, allowing your body to hinge forward.\n\n4. **Key point**: Keep your weight in your heels and your chest up, avoiding letting your back arch or your posture break.\n\n5. Continue lowering until your thighs are parallel to the ground, or as low as you can comfortably go.\n\n6. Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement before beginning the upward phase.\n\n7. **Upward phase**: As you return to standing, push with your heels and press through your entire foot to avoid sacrificing proper posture.\n\nRemember: Keep your core engaged throughout the entire exercise.",
