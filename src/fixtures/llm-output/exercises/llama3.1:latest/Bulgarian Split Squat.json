  "category": "Legs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your back to a stable object (such as a bench or chair) that you can use for support.\n2. Place one foot on the floor in front of you, keeping it behind the other foot. The back leg should be straight and the front leg bent at 90 degrees.\n3. Place the other foot up against the stable object so your leg is parallel to the ground. This will act as a support for your body and help maintain balance.\n4. Lower yourself down into a lunge-like position, keeping the front knee behind the toes but not extending past them.\n5. Keep the back leg straight and engage your core muscles to maintain stability throughout the movement.\n6. Lower until your thigh is parallel to the ground or the desired depth for you.\n7. Push through your front heel to return to standing.\n8. Repeat on the other side by bringing the back foot forward and switching positions with the front foot.",
