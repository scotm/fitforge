  "how_to_perform": "# Walking Bridge Exercise\n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n1. Start by kneeling on the ground with your hands placed shoulder-width apart in front of you. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels, and your hands should be directly under your shoulders.\n2. As you begin to lower yourself towards the ground, start walking your hands forward while keeping your feet stationary. Continue to lower your body until your chest almost touches or lightly drapes on the ground.\n3. Now, reverse the motion by 'walking' your hands back towards your feet while maintaining the straight line from head to heels.\n4. Keep your body stable and rigid throughout the movement by engaging your core and keeping your glutes activated.\n5. Focus on using your arms for support while walking out to an L-position on your elbows, as your hips and knees provide the stability.\n6. Practice control and deliberate movements during this exercise.",
