  "name": "Thruster",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a barbell with the weight in front of your shoulders and your hands gripping the bar with an overhand grip.\n\n2. Hinge at your hips and knees to lower your body until your back is almost parallel to the ground, keeping the barbell close to your shins.\n\n3. Next, push through your heels and extend your legs to return to standing in a squat position, keeping the barbell close to your shoulders throughout the movement.\n\n4. From this bottomed out position, immediately drive upwards and thrust the weight overhead by extending your arms fully, squeezing at the top of the movement.\n\n5. Pause briefly in this raised position before rapidly lowering yourself back down into the starting squat position.\n\n6. Repeat the rapid thruster movements for the desired number of repetitions, focusing on controlled breathing throughout the exercise.",
