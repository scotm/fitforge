  "name": "YTs",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start in a standing position with your feet hip-width apart and engage your core.\n\n2. Take a large step forward with one foot (either leg) and keep the heel of that foot on or just behind the toes of the other foot.\n\n3. As you take this step, lower your body down into a lunge by bending both knees until they form a 90-degree angle.\n\n4. Keep your back straight and your front knee directly above your ankle.\n\n5. Push through your front heel to return to standing, but avoid pushing off with just one foot - keep the entire foot (that was forward) grounded.\n\n6. Once you are back up to standing, reverse the movement by taking a large step backward with the same leg that took you into the lunge position.\n\n7. Lower down again and repeat the process for multiple repetitions on each leg.",
