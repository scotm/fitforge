  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, facing a wall or sturdy object.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your hips do not sag or pike upwards throughout the movement.\n\n3. Reach across the front of your body with both arms, keeping them straight and your hands flat against the wall or object.\n\n4. As you reach across your body, stretch your chest muscles to oppose the contraction in your shoulder blades, while maintaining a slight rotation in your torso. Focus on squeezing your scapulae together.\n\n5. Hold this position for 1-5 seconds, focusing on the contraction in your shoulders and serratus anterior muscles.\n\n6. Release slowly back to the starting position, without letting your arms or shoulders sag or lose tension.\n\n7. Repeat for 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions on each side.",
