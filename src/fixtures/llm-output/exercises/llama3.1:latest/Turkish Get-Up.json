  "name": "Turkish Get-Up",
  "how_to_perform": "1. **Lie on your back** with a weight or dumbbell held close to one shoulder, palm facing your ear. Engage your core muscles to stabilize your body.\n\n2. Lift the working leg and hold it straight up in the air, about 45 degrees from your torso. Keep your other leg and arm still.\n\n3. Using your core strength to lift, slowly raise your hips off the ground and come into a seated position with both legs together. Your back should be nearly flat on the floor.\n\n4. As you sit up with your legs together, reach over with your free hand to hold onto the weight or dumbbell.\n\n5. Now get to your feet in one smooth motion, using the momentum from coming up out of the seated position to propel yourself upright.\n\n6. Stand tall with both feet shoulders-width apart and fully engaged core muscles.\n\n7. Repeat on the other side by lying back down and repeating the process.",
