  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by bending your body forward at the hips, forming a small incline with your back and keeping it flat all throughout the exercise.\n\n2. Place your feet shoulder-width apart on the ground while standing upright, facing a set of dumbbells that are shoulder-height or slightly lower than your shoulders.\n\n3. Grasp the dumbbells using an overhand grip, with your palms facing towards each other, making sure to keep your hands and wrists in line.\n\n4. From this position, gently sway or shift both legs back slightly while maintaining balance all throughout the movement.\n\n5. With your arms still held straight out from your sides and at a moderate distance apart, bend your torso forward further so that it matches your arm level. Maintain an evenly weighted arm stance as required for proper execution of this exercise.\n\n6. Gradually tilt backwards by pushing both knees off the ground just enough to engage your lower back muscles more during each repetition, all while holding dumbbells in hand with one hand over the other side.\n\n7. Press one dumbbell straight up from your side until it's at chest level. \n\n8.Lift and slightly twist this raised dumbbell as far away from your head as possible before starting to slowly lower it back down without swaying or rocking your body unnecesarily for a more stable, controlled recovery motion.\n\n9.Repeat the entire exercise using the opposite arm after completing each repetition with one side.",
