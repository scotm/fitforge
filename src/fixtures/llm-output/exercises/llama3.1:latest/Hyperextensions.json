  "how_to_perform": "1. Lie on a hyperextension bench or a flat surface with your stomach facing down and your arms extended above you with your hands holding onto the bar for support.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your hips do not sag or tilt to one side throughout the movement.\n\n3. Slowly lift your torso off the ground by squeezing your lower back muscles, keeping your eyes on a point directly in front of you.\n\n4. Focus on contracting and lifting from your lats and lower back, rather than using momentum or leaning forward.\n\n5. Lift as high as is comfortable for you, without overextending.\n\n6. Slowly lower yourself back down to the starting position by releasing the contraction in your lower back muscles.\n\n7. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.",
