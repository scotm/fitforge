Approach the sloper and position yourself with both hands on the starting holds, gripping them firmly as you would in a pull-up.\n3. From this point, fully extend yourself and reach outwards into the gap, keeping your body flat and your legs straight.\n4. Engage your core muscles to support your body position, keeping your hips down and preventing swinging or swaying motions in your upper body.\n5. Hold the position for as long as possible, maintaining control and focus to develop strength and stability.\n6. When you're ready to release, slowly lower yourself back down to a controlled stop.",
