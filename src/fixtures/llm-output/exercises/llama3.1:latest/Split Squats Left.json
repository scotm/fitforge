  "name": "Split Squats Left",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by standing with your feet wide apart, with one foot forward and the other foot backward (your left foot should be forward for this exercise). Make sure the heel of the back foot is flat on the ground.\n\n2. Bend your front knee (left knee) so that it's about to touch the ground, keeping your weight in your front leg. The back thigh should be almost straight.\n\n3. Keep your front foot pointing downwards with your toe slightly off the ground and the other foot pointing behind you with the heel flat on the ground.\n\n4. Lower yourself down into a lunge position, while keeping the knee of your back leg (right knee) from lowering below or equaling your hip (for proper form). This will target only one leg at time for strengthening.\n\n5. Keep your core tight and chest looking forward to avoid discomfort in the shoulders and spine region during execution (from bent posture).\n\n6. Push yourself up to the starting position with strength, feeling the burn in the targeted quadriceps muscles on that same lead side.\n\n7. Repeat this process as instructed for a few sets.",
