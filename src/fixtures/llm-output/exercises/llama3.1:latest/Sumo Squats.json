  "how_to_perform": "* Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, turning your toes outwards slightly to form a soft V-shape with your body.\n\n* Lower yourself into a seated position by bending both knees, keeping them behind your toes. Your back should remain straight and engaged throughout the movement.\n\n* Keep your weight evenly distributed on both feet as you sink deeper into the squat.\n\n* Use this moment to stretch your glutes, lower back, and calves while feeling the engagement in your leg muscles.\n\n* Stand up to the starting position by pushing through your heels, extending your legs fully. Keep your core engaged for stability and control throughout.\n\n* Repeat for a specified number of repetitions, maintaining proper form and engaging your leg muscles with each squat.",
