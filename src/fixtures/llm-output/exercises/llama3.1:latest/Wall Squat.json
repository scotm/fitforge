  "name": "Wall Squat",
  "how_to_perform": "1. Stand with your back against a wall and feet shoulder-width apart, about 12-18 inches away from the wall.\n\n2. Place your hands on the wall for balance if needed, keeping them directly above your shoulders.\n3. Slowly slide your back down the wall, allowing your hips to press backward while keeping your back in contact with the wall.\n\n4. Keep your knees bent at a 90-degree angle or slight bend and your weight centered, ensuring that your body is stable and strong.\n\n5. As you lower yourself into the squat position, engage your core muscles by drawing your belly button towards your spine.\n6. Hold the squat for the desired duration (typically 10-30 seconds), rest, then repeat for more repetitions.\n7. If needed, step away from the wall to return to standing and stretch before repeating.\n\n**Tips:**\n* Keep your core engaged throughout the exercise to maintain proper form and protect your lower back.\n* Adjust your distance from the wall if you find the wall too close or too far based on your height and personal comfort level.",
