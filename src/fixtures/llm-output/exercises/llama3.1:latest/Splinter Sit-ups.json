  "how_to_perform": "1. Start by lying on your back on the ground, with your arms extended overhead and your legs straight.\n\n2. Engage your core by pulling your belly button towards your spine, ensuring that your lower back does not arch or your hips do not sag upwards throughout the movement.\n\n3. Slowly lift your shoulders off the ground without lifting your feet, keeping your lower back pressed into the ground.\n\n4.
